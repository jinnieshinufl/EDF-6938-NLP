            "In this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @PERSON3's life, the mood containing it all, was greatful, and showed how his parents gave him love through his whole life. Both his parents were born and raised in Cuba, and in 1956, they both moved to the United States. Starting their lives over again, and taking any job they could find. Then in 1961, @PERSON2, @CAPS1. was born. Both Parents raised him with love, and care, and introducing his Cuban background into his life.        As @PERSON2, was telling his story, all readers could tell how greatful he was to have a family like he did. Also, as he shared his non-– blood related family, and the remembrence on how his parents' life changed by moving to @LOCATION2, he showed the respect he had towards them. Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, manages to maintain a single overall mood. In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood so it lead me to think was nostalgia, but nowhere does it emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became\" family\" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents helped so many in need. If in Rodriguez's position I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and upbringing of their son. The mood the author created in the memoir is love. the author finds out that family doesn't have to be blood related. In the author's neighborhood \"despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in solidarity and friendship\" (@NUM1). The author loves thier parents because they came \"as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life\" (@NUM2). The author is very greatful that her parents \"Mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture\" (@NUM3). The author's parents gave him a great life by moving to @LOCATION1 and \"turned this simple house into a @NUM4). The mood created in the memoir is happiness and gratitude. Narciso is grateful of his parents for moving to @LOCATION1, and still give him warm happy feeling of a house in Cuba. His parents passed down their culture to him and he is happy that they did. Narciso is glad to have lived in the home that they did, and all the opertunities that he had as a child. He is grateful that his family always got together and had a feast with cuban music, activities, and food. His parents gave up their jobs and had to Start their lives over entirely. Narciso is also grateful that he learned the real definition of \"family\". He is also very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. The mood definitely helps you feel and comprehend the story better. The mood is a mixture of both happy and sad because of the way the author states his ideas. For example, the sentence \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" makes me feel sad because he grew up and everything is just memories now but he keeps those happy memories. Most of other ideas like \"I will be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" also carry the same reasons for being happy or sad. However statements like \"My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture\" makes me feel happy that his parents were so determind. Overall the main idea is remembering the good and bad times of his life and the mood for this idea is happy/sad. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\" he/she incorporated love and passion into the mood. You can tell this by how fondly and strongly Narciso talks about some things. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm houses.\" In this one sentence alone, you could feel Narciso's passion and love for this home of the their's. Narciso puts a great deal of love and thankfulness into paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 when talking about his/her parents. \"It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'... I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" These two sentences are most likely the strongest in Narciso's memoir, these two are also the ones filled with the most passion and meaning. As you can see, in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\", the mood Narciso puts in it is love and passion.  The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and fortunate. Narciso Rodriguez talks about being so fortunate to have his parents and his heritage of being Cuban. From paragraph @NUM1, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 is saying that @CAPS1 was so happy and lucky to have his parents as parents which is the main mood of the memoir.Another mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is happiness. @CAPS1 makes the story happy by saying how great it was to grow up with his family. @CAPS1 also says that his family was a lot of people in his neighborhood as well. @CAPS1 is happy to have a great family. From paragraph @NUM2, \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\"@CAPS2 are two moods created by Rodriguez in his memoir. The author generally stayed in one mood. The mood portrayed in the story was family and friends are very important and they help what you will be in the future. This is why the author stressed how thankful he was that his family had come to @LOCATION1 to make him a better life and that his friends came over to share their culture. Also the author was saying that even in @LOCATION1 it was important to remember his cuban blood and culture. This is why he says \"...and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas, of the kitchen.\" Also the author say's that a home is where geat memeries are and were you grow up, you should never forget it. The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with, and other friends to help them if anything. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they (main character) had the first birthday and first friend. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also my first friend. I also said worth living because they had food on their table everyday. And nothing in the memoir said anything about struggling. This is why I explain the mood as happy, enjoyable, and worth living.  The mood created by the author in this memoir was very loving and caring for their friends, family and everyone around them, for example it says how his mom would always keep the door open for whoever was going through a rough time or untill they were back on their feet because she knew they would do the same for her and her family. Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in. The author of this memoir created a mood about family. \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country the loved,\" this quote tells that the mood created by the author makes the reader realize how hard their pareents work to give their children a better life and education. \"It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\",\" this also makes the reader feel like there is a lot more to a family then what it @MONTH1 seem. That family gives one life and teaches love. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,\" this quote tells that home is not just a place where one @MONTH1 live, but that it is about relationships that are created there. These were some of the moods created by the author in the memoir. The mood set by the author in the memoir is a home is home kind of mood, like a great family, great friendships/relationships and open arms kind of feeling. He mentions the fact that his parents always helped friends and family in need and how selfless they were towards other people. He talks about how him and his family used to come together and have meals as a family. He says he is grateful for the spirit an generosity given to him by his parents at a young age. He gives the reader a sence of comfort and generosity and he thanks his family deeply for expressing spirit, generosity and selflessnes to people. In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negitive for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negitive things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others. The mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented. From the very beginning, the author describes the home as more of a way of life than a physical space. The author's \"parents created our traditional Cuban home, part of which was the kitchen\" (@NUM1). Here, the home is described even more as a part of the family, less is a building.     To enhance the feeling of family, the author includes stories of hospitality: \"My parents always kept their arms and their door to the many people he considered family\" (@NUM2). Hospitality is one of the best qualities you need to make a house a home and the author really stretches that. The mood created by the author of the memoir is cozy and family oriented. Based on this memoir, the mood created by the author it's a great mood unexplainable. in this article talks about a young man named @PERSON1 and how his life was from then and now. for example, on paragraph @NUM1, says he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices. and how he had always told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. Also, how Cuban music was so passionate, adored so much, and how his parents turned a simple house into a home. therefore, this is the mood created by the author. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez was happy and thankful. His parents taught him many things about their cuban back ground, like cooking and music. His parents gave up many things to comfort Narciso and make him at home. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" His parents turned their house into a home for other People as well. \"My parents always kept their Arms and door open to the many people we considered family.\" Narciso's parents would take in anybody that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Narciso's parents were very loving to the community and help out as much as the could in making that place at home. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a serious, happy and thankful mood. The author was serious to the point where his family had to go through economic and personal problems. However, the author was happy how they lived in a friendly and unified neighborhood with other immigrant from different countrys. The author showed thankfulness because his parents worked so hard to give him a new life. The memoir showed a good mood as well as a accurate portrait of the athour childhood. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the mood and feeling of her home and comunity is a happy and heartwarming situation. Most people who would live in a tiny apartment in the city would say that it was to small and cramped, while they wished for a mansion on the ocean, but Narciso was perfectly happy being in that environment. The way she described it, there were always great smells, wounderful music, and great people around all of the time. Narciso said the man people who contributed the most to her wounderful experience in New Jersey were her parents. They supported and cared for her at the same time they were strugling for money. They never showed sadness and they loved and cared for her. Even though Narciso lived in a small apartment in the city, she and her family show that you can make the best out of any situation. In the memoir \"@PERSON1 Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood is a very important part of the story. The mood in this memoir is definiatley thankfulness. The first reason for why the mood of this story is thankfulness is because @PERSON1 is thankful for his Cuban heritage. @PERSON1 shows his love for his heritage by stating \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills\". @PERSON1 is very thankful that he has these skills from his great culture. The second reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his home. \"...Formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\", @PERSON1 writes in his memoir. This quote shows that @PERSON1 is thankful for a nice place to call his home. the final reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his hardworking parents. \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and i've thank them repeatedly\", he comments. This undoubtably shows the author's great respect for his parents and all they have to offer for him to be happy and healthy. Thankfulness is a mood that suits this memoir very well, and the pride and gratefulness that the author shows for his heritage, home, and parents is wonderful. The mood created by the author in \"Narciso Rodriguez\"is very calm and happy. The author This very calm and cool. There are no loud or emphasized parts. It is also very happy. It describes a family growing and getting to love each other. Also frends and more family having happy times having celebrations. The happiest line was the last, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple little house into a home.\" It also has a very loving tone to it. Anything about a family coming together is loving. The author could have put alot of different types of mood in the memoir. I think that the mood of the memoir is happy, greatful and appreciated. I said happy because he talks about every thing he does and how he enjoys it I said greate because he is always thanking his parents and he admires them. He admires them because thy have comed last to the good life and they do everything in their power to have a good life. An he appreciates him because of the same thing I said before he admires them and always thank them for what they have done to her. This is the mood the authors has toward writting the story. In Narciso's memoir, I feel joy. I feel joy because Narciso's parents were able to survive. They came to @LOCATION1, \"without any knowledge of the language or culture.\" @CAPS1 immigrant families do not get on there feet right away and they did, within a year they went from a @NUM1 room apartment to a @NUM2 room appartment.Joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms to there family. People today are losing there jobs & homes and they have nobody to go to, but the Rodriguez family had a place to go. \"Countless extaded family members came & went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms & their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" The mood created by the author in the menoir. The author was grateful that the chance to growing up in the @LOCATION1. The title named is Narciso Rodriguez. He talks about his life, that he came from cuba. and that his parent welcomes people that come from cuba. They come \"together in a great solidarity and friendship.\" I think his mood is every happy. To see that his parent made something out of notthing. The author parent show him with their life, and his teaching have been the basis of his life. I feel the same way because my parent brought me here for a better life. I think you learn everything from your parent How to act and all that. So yea the last sentence he said I liked it. He said I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home. Author Narciso Rodriguez describes his love and happiness towards his family in this memoir. He states how his parents gaveup everything not for themselves for him and his relatives. The community they moved to was so happy and also like his family to him. Narciso describes how him and his family keep their @CAPS1 culture with them and he appresiates it. The last sentence truely says it all \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\". All of that shows how during this memoir his mood is happy, loving, and grateful all at once. The authors mood in the memoir @PERSON1 is thankful. I know this, because in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 talks about his culinary skills and how grateful he is to have it passed down to him. This shows us that he is very much thankful for this skill, because some people don't know how to cook and to be able to cook is a blessing. This also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person. @PERSON2 quotes \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.\" In @CAPS2, this shows us that @PERSON2 was very much appreciative of all that his parents had done for him. Also that he loved his parents dearly and every chance he gets, he thanks them. Therefore in the memoir Narciso gives off the mood of being thankful. The author's interpretation of their childhood home set a mood of love and compassion. He writes about his parents in a way that informs the reader that they were extremely good people. He describes them, as well as others in their community, as honest, hardworking, selfless people. He writes the story with much appreciation of his parents, family, and life, which is very admirable. He describes that he lived in a house with only three rooms, and yet his parents made a home out of it and welcomed others to stay, too. The mood that this author set was that of love and compassion, and he did a very good job of explaining what his childhood home meant to him. In this memoir, there are moods created by the author in the memoir. One mood in the memoir was peaceful. In this excerpt it stated, \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great soliderity and friendship.\" This meant that everyone got along with no fighting unlike segregation dowin  the @CAPS1 at the time. Another mood is humble. A quote from the text says, \"I will always be greatful to my parent for their love and sacrifice.\" This shows that no matter what @CAPS3 will @CAPS2 his parents. Lastly, the author created the mood modesty. To prove this @CAPS3 stated, \"They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life.\" @CAPS3 means that his parents (they) had Showed him everything @CAPS3 knows today. Therefore, this memoir has moods that are created by the author. The mood that takes place in this article would be sorrow, excitement, and being grateful for the parents he had. Narciso is grateful for the culinary skills and traditions that his parents passed on to him. Just like me most of my life I lived an apartment and saw it as any other home because of the parents you have there that care for you. Also growing up in that enviroment taught him family doesn't have to be blood related, it could neighbors or friends that could be like a brother, sister, aunt, uncle. The mood in this story was security and happiness. Security was prevailed when all different people with different culture and heritage could live together without fights or arguments at a time when there was a lot of racial tension in @LOCATION1. Happiness was showed in many different ways. One way was when he was describing the warmth, music and cooking in his house. Also, when he was talking about how thankful he was for what his parents sacrificed for him. Overall, @PERSON1 was happy about how his whole childhood when and it seemed like he loved every last minute of it. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. He seems happy because, he talks about his parents, his family, and his home which make him happy. In paragraph @NUM1, the author talks about how being blood-related doesn't have to do with family. In paragraph  two, the author talks about the simple house that his parents made a home. When you read paragraph  two, and how he describes the home, the author makes you feel happy. In paragraph @NUM2, the author says how he will always be grateful for his parents and the life that they gave him. That is the mood and some examples created by the author in the memoir. The @CAPS2 had many mood in the memoir. The mood that @CAPS1 mostly had was happy and greatfull for having his family and friends near him. @CAPS1 was sad because @CAPS1 didnt have his granparents with him @CAPS1 said \"I would not know my real grand parents Narciso the Elder and consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba.\" @CAPS1 was happy that his parents that his parents left everything for him to have a better life. The @CAPS2 is a strong person and had a lot of good and bad moods in The memoir.  The mood in the memoir \"Narciso @CAPS1\" is a Open happy familly because her parents worked and made a wonderful home for her. I think the mood in the story is a open happy family becase in the text it says \"Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being blood related\" and that @CAPS3 that when @CAPS2 was growing up her family had a bunch of people that were considered family but not blood related. Also the text said \"It was a close knit community of honest, hardworking imigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.\" That just @CAPS3 that her parants let anyone from their community who needed a family become part of their familly, or anybody who was lonley just have some company from them. The mood the author creates in this memoir is a feeling of relationships and love between so called 'extended family'. The author emphasizes the relationship between Narciso Rodriguez's family and the surrounding neihbors is so close that they could be family. The author incorporates the feeling of overall joy and happiness this boy has, even though they have a small house, they could still turn it into a loving home. The author shows how much this boy loves the heritage he has and his fun parents who taught him to love cooking and cuban music. This memoir shows how he is poor, but still can have a fun and interesting life with lots of friends and fond memories. Narciso is very thankful for his parents and this shows how appreciative he is of the simplist things iand home. The overall mood in this memoir would have to be thankfulness. The characters are so thankfull for everything they have. In this excerpt from \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a very clear mood in the memoir. Narciso Rodriguez's \"eternally grateful for his family and everything they did for him. For example, \"[Narciso Rodriguez] will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done.\" @CAPS1 admires \"their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" @PERSON1 feels that \"there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" @PERSON1 \"learned the real definition of 'family.'\" @PERSON1 \"will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" The mood created in the memoir is grateful. \"My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwrittingly Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today\". What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents. \"I would always be grateful to my Parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the besis of my life. What I mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him. The mood in this memoir is grateful because he love and cherrishes and cares about his mom and dad. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author's mood was happiness. He explains that he is greatful for his parents for her home, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The author also shows that she was taught how to do things by her parents, and that she was happy that they did that. He thinks that family and friends are important too. For these reasons, the author created the mood of happiness in his memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because Narciso is happy for everything that has happened Narciso is happy for his family and his native haratige. For example in the beginning of the story is says Narciso loves he haratige and his family. This means he's happy. The mood created by the author is a happy mood. I think that it is a happy mood because Narciso is describing his life, and at the end he says he has a happy life. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). I think that this is a happy statement because he is saying that his parents cared so much for him, and they turned what could have been a bad house, into a home. I think that it is a happy mood because of the way he talks about his neighbors. \"It was a close – knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need\" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). I think that since he talks about his friends and neighbors so well that it is a happy neighborhood. A @NUM3 and final reason I think it is a happy mood is because of the way he speaks of his family. \"They came selflessly… to give their children a better life… I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice\" (@CAPS3 @NUM4 and @NUM5). I think that he loves his family, and love is definitely a happy word. The mood  displayed by the author was a warm cozy feeling that felt like home. It showed his small house and family and their interests and how they all acted together. It really showed what he called home and what he called a family. The memoir explained the food he ate and the music he heared all through out his childhood and how he grew up. The mood in this memoir is heartwarming.This memoir is heartwarming because it's about her parents came from Cuba to the @CAPS1. S. It's nice how the blonde-brick house was better but still the same as the house their parents lived in. The Cuban music filled the air of the house like it was a house in Cuba. A house isn't a house untill you call it a home. That family has made that their home forever. Even though their family can't come down till 1970 they too will have a place to call home like Narciso Rodriguez did. Like he said in the memoir \"I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home\". The mood that the author has is, and happy. I know this because @CAPS1 talks about his family and friends and his @CAPS3. @CAPS1 starts to tell us about his first friend @PERSON1 and how they lived above him. \"@PERSON1 my babysitter and my first friend lived above us and @PERSON1 graced our table for meals more often than not.\" @CAPS1 @CAPS2 how it was to make his first friend. @CAPS1 also went on to explane how his parents made the house and how @CAPS3 will stay there forever. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 is really greatful and his mood is happy and calm. Because hes talking about how his family started and how @CAPS1 met his friends. In the memoir the author created a mood by using details about the setting and the chareters, one of the mood that was in the story is friendship. In paragraph @NUM1, it says \"@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not.\" The author is explaining that he had family friends over to his house to eat almost every night. Another mood that is in the memoir is careing. In paragraph @NUM1, it says \"there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.\" This shows that even though the authors family had a small home they let people stay with them untill they could leave. The last mood in the memoir is happiness. In paragraph @NUM3, it says \"I celebrated my first birthdays. Mood it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast alwase filled the air.\" The author explains how he had his birthday with his friends and family. These are only three of the main moods in the story. The @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS3 very happy and always like they are doin something as a family. it shows this in @CAPS4 @NUM1 throughout the whole thing. it shows that @CAPS5 it shows how he is @CAPS6 much as close to his family as he is to the others around him. and that should mean a lot of things @CAPS5 he really doesnt know much english and all those people are goin to be an important influence on his life As an @CAPS8 and non-Cuban, that is how and where it shows @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2. When an author is writing, setting the mood is really important. The mood created in the memoir is heartwarming and it shows how greatful this person is for their home, although it was extremely small.Narciso Rodriguez lived in a small crowded home, however it was the fact that his parents tried hard to make sure that Narciso had a good life, that made his house great. His parents made the best of what they had and filled it with passion, love, and laughter.The author did a very good job setting the mood of the memoir. When he was talking about his home readers could almost feel the love, @CAPS1 the food, and listen to the music. The mood is uplifting and the author shows a lot of gratitude.It makes you smile when you read the memoir because of all the pleasent memories and the caring and giving.Narciso Rodriguez had amazing parents who did so much for him. In his memoir, he does an excellent job setting the mood and readers can tell how greatful he is. The mood the author created in the memoir is a roller coaster. It goes up and down. At the beginning of this story, it was quit deppressing. It's basically just Rodriguez describing the crummy quarters he lived in. But, as the story progresses, it is filled with happiness and even though living conditions werent all that great, he still had fun. In the end, home is about relationships rather than physical space. In the @CAPS1, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates afeeling of family, home and culture. \"Created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.\" This quote shows that Narciso and his family had a great understanding and gratefulness for their culture. The @CAPS1 says that they opened the door to any one who came in and they always shared dinner with family. That shows the close-knit family @CAPS2 grew up in. Narciso tells how his parents turned a house into a home. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 talks about how his Cuban roots and parents love helped to create a home and not just a simple house. In this article, Rodriguez creates a warm and calm mood by talking about his Home. @CAPS1 explians how tight-knit his family and nienborhood was because of the love and compasion of thier culture. By saying this @CAPS1 creates a warm calm mood inviting you (figuratively) into his home and childhood. In this memoir the mood created by the author is gratefulness, happiness and unity. This is noticeable in many different ways such as when Narciso says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This shows gratefulness Narciso per trays to his parents for giving up their life in Cuba. Another example of mood in this memoir is when Narciso states \"Here in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations....\" This passage shows happiness in Narciso's home. It is evident by the tone used by the author that these were happy times. Lastly when Narciso says, \"In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together.\" This shows unity in the story despite the different races of people who lived around Narciso. This is how happiness, gratefulness, and unity created a mood in this memoir. The mood from my perspective would be a calm and cozy sentimental feeling. When the author would talk about how his parents passed so many feelings and so much culture it made me think about who I am and where I am from. It gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the cooking and music and family and I can relate to that. It gave me a feeling of perseverance and to not stop striving for what you believe in.  It made me feel strong and inspired my the mother and father's dedication to family. The mood of the memoir by @PERSON1 is love and compassion for his parents. He tells how he grew up with pride for Cuba and how he still loves Cuban music. His parents gave him these qualities which he adores but he is \"eternally grateful for his rich culinary skills that were passed on to him by his parents. @PERSON1 also talked about the role of \"family\" in the environment in which he grew up in. In his neighborhood, many people were the victims of racism, so they all came together to be a stronger whole. By growing up like this he learned how to give a helping hand to those who were in need. @PERSON1 also told the reader of the courage his parents had by leaving everything they knew and loved behind and how he wished he could have that same courage, but at least he knew of it. In the memoir from: Home The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez. The mood Narciso creates In his memoir is a sort of loving mood. This mood is described by The @CAPS1 \"I learned there how to love. I will never forget, and parents turned this simple house into a home\". this shows how he loved his home. Also The @CAPS1 \"passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today and to that I am externaly grateful. This shows he loved That his parents passed on to him a love of cooking and cooking skills In the memoir \"@PERSON1\" by himself he creates a tone of love. It is tone of love because he explains that his parents taught him many great things. Also that he is grateful and thankful to everything his parent's gave him, as it says in paragraph @NUM1. For example he explains that family doesn't have to be blood related. His parents taught him that anybody you can trust his family, anybody that you help because you know they will do the same for you. Also in the last sentence it says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\". So the author's tone for his memoir is love and that he is grateful for everything with his parents. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood was well shown in a few ways. \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwillingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful).\" The mood is is happy and greatfull for what Narciso learned. \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" In the parenthesis it emphasizes the love Narciso has for Cuban music even more. \"Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often then not.\" This here shows how friendly both the families are together and they are happy to enjoy these meals. The mood created by the author in the memoir was \"solidority.\" because in paragraph @NUM1 it says \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their non culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me to today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" also in paragraph @NUM2 it says. \"growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that \"family had nothing to do with being blood related.\" This is now the mood created by the author was \"solidarity\". In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, these are some examples about the mood in the memoir. First you should always be happy no matter what culture your in. \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" located in paragraph @NUM1. It doesnt matter what culture you are in. Second, be happy from where you come from. \"I was born into this simple house, situated, in a two-family, blond-brick, building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey,\" located in paragraph @NUM2. You should be happy from what town you are from. Lastly, never forget who really matters. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,\" located in paragraph @NUM3. You should always be thankful to you parents. In conclusion these moods are the examples of the memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very grateful and kind for many reasons. Narciso Rodriguez he tells why his parents made a hard choice to come to @LOCATION1 and leave all their friends, family, and careers behind. He really shows the people who have read his memoir that he respects his parents and thanks them so much to make his life better in @LOCATION1. This memoir relates to people and real life. He explains where he comes from and he just loves the way he can live his life simple and be happy for what he had accomplished so far (and his parents). In his memoir the details and the description just makes you want to keep reading and learn more about his life. In conclusion, every-thing in the memoir is so kind and precious to him. In \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the author Narciso Rodriguez, write a memoir about his childhood. In the story he thanks his parent for thier courage in coming to @LOCATION1. As well as his cuban upbringing. He describes how thier house was always full with family and friend and how there was always a big cuban feast and cultural music playing. Finally, Narciso depicts how his community that he lived in was unity and strong even though they did not have the same heritage or background.The mood in which Narciso creates his memoir is very upbeat. He never says anything negative about his family, friend, or community. Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for his heritage and thier will to give him a better life. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1, Narciso uses parentheses to give more background information.Narciso's memoir was a very heart felt story. It made me feel like even through hard times people can find the good in things. This story makes me think of my dad because when things go wrong he can always make a joke or find the bright side of the story. the mood was definatly uplifting and happy. at first when he describes his \"house\" he says within these walls my young parents treated our traditional cuban \"home\". You see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them. with their kitchen as the \"heart\" (happy heart) cuban music fills the air/ (which he adores). this is just a verry uplifting story how he was born into a cuban, Spanish, Italian people dealt with racism and his parents are welcoming in their extended big extended family  into sleep eat everything. this is a good family and like he said family is not about being blood related its about loving them the way they come and still be in their homes. their family is without a worry all about love and courage his parenths taught him something special and how you can have more than a blood related family. All you need is a little selfishness and alot of courage. I think that the mood created by the author was happiness. I think this because when @CAPS1 was talking throughout the story @CAPS1 talked about how great her life was and how nice your parents are. @CAPS1 talked about her life as being very nice because @CAPS1 grew up in a house that turned into a home. Also, @CAPS1 talked about the great cooking that went on in her house and all of the great music, that @CAPS1 still loves today. Also, @CAPS1 talks about how caring her parents were when they opened there doors to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Lastly, I think the mood set by the author was happiness because @CAPS1 had a lot of her family or close friends living either above or below them. Those are the reasons I thought the mood set by the author was happiness. The mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important. Family is very important an example of that in paragraph @NUM1 is when the author @PERSON1 writes \"Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sence that \"family\" had nothing to do with being blood relatives.\"The second way that shows family is important is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author writes \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.The third and final example is in paragraph @NUM3 when the author writes, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 three examples show that family is the most important thing. The mood of the author in this memoir was happy, grateful, and gratitude. I say happy because in the story the author said \"in our neighborhood despite customs else where, all of the cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship. I say happy because the author was happy to enjoy having so many friends and family to come over everyday and have fun. another mood is grate full the author as it says in the story \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The author says this because the authors parents loved him a lot they went out every day trying to get money to make sure the author had a good life and the author was greatful for that. Now the author had gratitude for all the things the author's parents did \"parents created our traditional Cuban home\" also \"passed on to me the rich culonary skills and love for cooking\" and \"where I celebrated my first birthdays\". The author had gratitude for all these things and more because without the things his parents did he wouldn't be who he is today. I think the mood in this story was sad/happy. I think it was happy because it says he loved to cook  And he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook.  Also In paragraph @NUM1 Its a paragraph dedicated to his parents. I think it is sad because in paragraph @NUM2 it says his parents had very good Jobs but when they came to the united states they had to startover. In the memoir the expressed different moods. One of these moods were appreciative, he was appreciative that his parents made a house into a home. They made him happy by the way his parents passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking and their passionate cuban music which filled the air of his home. The author also expresses how he is grateful that his parents left their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved so that they could come to america, start their life over, have a better life for themselves and himself. The author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article. The author created a feeling of homeliness and peace. He created this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate. Also while reading he talks about how him and his family always helped each other out. He also considers his community family and that really makes you feel at peace inside. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created Is happy and loving. In the memoir it says, \"In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" @CAPS1 of people were very close to his family and @CAPS2 found out you don't have to be blood relatives to be family. Also it says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS2 is happy his parents moved to @LOCATION1 and is grateful of the sacrifices they had to make do do it. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. @CAPS2 went from Just living there to it being his home. @CAPS2 appieriates all his parents have done to make his life better. The mood created by the author in the memoir is how she learned the definition of \"family\". She learned the definition of \"family\" at what she calls it her \"simple house\". I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, she says \"It was here where I learned the definition of \"family.'  In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives,\" the author creats a special mood. I think the mood is kind of both happy and sad at the same time. It is sad because the parents had to leave all of their family, friends, and careers back in Cuba, while coming to @LOCATION1 not Knowing the language. He didn't even get to meet his real grand parents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. The mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child. He gets to live a happy life in their new home, with their new friends. In this memoir gives a grateful feeling. Some of the reasons I think this is because like in paragraph @NUM1. The author says \"…our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuba, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevail in the United States.\" But the main part of the story is that how he loves the neighborhood he lives in and the house he lives in and mostly how much the people are basically family in that neighborhood. And that is why I think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir. In the story \"Narciso Rodriguez\", the mood in the story is willing, greatful, and hopeful. \"The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times\" that quote represents that the family was willing to go through not having a good job like in cuba and segragtion to make a better life for their kids. \"My parents always kept there door open for the people we considered family\" this quote shows the family was was greatful to have a home and still let the people they loved live there with them. \"My mother and Father came to this country with such courage, with out knowlage of the language and culture. That quote showed that the family was hopeful enough that even without knowing about the country they still believed it would bring a better life. In the story \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the family was willing to do anything for a better life. During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're surrounded by people you love. The author created the mood of happiness, love, achievement, and being proud. Narciso was very proud of his cuban heratige, as well has his brave parents, that created a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home and childhood. The achievement was of his parents comming over to @LOCATION1 and starting a better life. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important. The mood created in this memoir was very greatful. Narciso was very very greatful for the \"house that his parents turned into a home.\" And he was very greatful to his overall parents, for giving up there own life, to try to give their son a better one, with many more oppertunities than they had. He is also greatful to his parents, not only for giving him things they never had, but things they did have, too. Things like teaching them how to cook, how to treat others, and the real meaning of family. They also showed him the value of being selfless for someone you love. No matter what nationality you are you can get along with anyone. He shows that his home, to him at least was a wonderful @CAPS1 with nice smells, food, and people. He is unexplainable happy and grateful for what his Parents did for him. To him it was @CAPS2/heaven on earth. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in the humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not Just scent and music but love and life. He will never forget that house or its gracious neigh bor hood. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created by the author. The mood is happiness and joyfulness because in this memoir the author continues to talk on about his family a culture which is a perfect reason for the mood to be happy. \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family.\" this quot was found in @CAPS1 @NUM1, this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous. This mood involved the familys culture which Narciso loved so much. His beautiful culture was just another piece of the puzzel that fit together, and that last quot \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home\" found in @CAPS1 @NUM2 really puts every thing together touching the reader emotionally. In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is very warm and inviting. It is of home and family. Some examples of this are, he mentioen that the kitchen was the heart of the home and the Cuban music was playing all the time. The memoir also conveys a sense of family because the author often mentions large amounts of family and friends would often be visiting. He also mentions there was rarely a time when was not staying with them in their home until they got back on their feet. The mood of this memoir is warming and of family. In the author's memoir the author creats a mood and that mood in the story as happyness anjoy. It is happyness and @CAPS1 becuse he was happy for his home and how his parents were cooks. He also joyed the music and things he does with his family and relitize. I think this is the mood the author used in the memoir. Narciso Rodriguez, a memoir about growing up in a new environment with his family, Narciso puts a definite mood in the memoir. The mood, to put it in general terms, is happy. The author did not put any negative information in the memoir and only put a positive feeling. In paragraph two, the author explains how his parents brought their Cuban heritage into their home like food, music, family gatherings, and fun celebrations. All of that set a very happy backdrop for the family. In paragraph four, Narciso shows that there was always people over and having a fun time. Narciso's surrogate grandparents, babysitter, cousins, and aunts and uncles came and had a good time. Finally in paragraph six, the author sums it up and tells that he will always be grateful for his parents' love and sacrifice. His parents were thanked repeatedly by him for their strength and perseverance and taught him that friends and family are very important. Overall, this memoir had a very positive and happy mood. Home and family is the @CAPS1 one thing all of us love. The mood the author created was heartwarming and appreciation, because he explains how comftable his home is with everyone, together having a good time. Not only Just being together but being together: \"Growing up in this enviroment instilled in him a great sense that \"familly\" nothing to do with being a Blood relative.\"Narciso Rodriguez show his appreciation for his parents he loved so much because they had to make an important change to give him a better life wiched he deseverd. They had made this change \"even though it meant leaving behind their families.\" Such bravery they had.The author left us knowing his appreciation for his \"home\" with being grateful for his parents and his hispanic heritage. The author created a mood in the memoir. The author creates the mood of friendliness. I know this because in the text it says \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solodalriy and friendship.\" This means that even though there was segregation around them, their neighborhood was still friendly. All and all, the author created a mood in the memoir. The mood created in this memoir is excilent. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This gives me the feeling of thankfulness and to really admire what my parents have done for me. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 it says \"It was here I learned the real definition of family.\" This quote makes me feel so happy that I have a family that supports me and is always there for me. This memoir really changed how I look at things and made me relize how thankful I am to have my family. The mood changed throughout the memoir. First the mood started off depressing by saying in Cuba they had a one room furnished apartment. That when they came to @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. Next mood was inspirring. It was inspirring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way to move out of cuba. Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need. Also they were always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogated grandparents Sergio and @CAPS1 there too. The mood changed throughout the whole memior from depressing to inspirring and to family which it always was about. Narciso was very proud of his cuban culture. He was very happy with who he had become, and how he had been raised. Narciso set a very proud and greatful tone to this memoir. He explains that family isnt about blood relations; its about people who love eachother, and are going to be there for eachother. He told us that his parents passed on the cuban culture to him, in cooking. He also explained how his parents built the home on their own, that he got to grow up in. Narciso says how proud he is to be a cuban, and how his family works @CAPS1 hard to earn a living. Narciso told us how proud and happy he was, to be in a nice home, with friends, family, and a future. He told us he learned to love. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, creates a mood of hardship, and gratefulness. [pg. @NUM1] \"after living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, @NUM2-year-old Rawedia and twenty-sevem-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon call home.\" @CAPS1 hardship how they moved from Cuba to the @LOCATION2 and had to leave everything behind to start a new life, in a small, little, apartment.     The memoir @CAPS1 gratefulness because Narciso is very grateful for his families sacrsfice for his future and for their caring and love. [pg @NUM3] \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\"     I think the memoir is a very heartwarming story of a family that loves one another and his thankful that they have a place they can call home. In the memoir \"Home: The Blueprints Of Our Lives\" the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a very loving mood.When Narciso Rodriguez is talking about his home he writes, \"Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen.\" This shows his love for his kitchen. @PERSON2 shows his love for cooking when he writes, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and un wittingly passed on to me their rich culinory skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today.\" @PERSON2 provides us the love that he has for his parents when he states, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 @PERSON2 tells us that his parents were very loving when he writes, \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" The mood created by the author in this memoir was happy, loving, and warm. The memoir is basically about family and how important family is. When you talk about your family, and its culture, you usually dont feel sad about it. Throughout the memoir. the author says things like, \"a love of cooking that is still with me today\" and \"formed a backdrop to life in our warm home\". The author also talks about the selflessness of his parents, which he is very proud and gratefull for. He states in paragraph @NUM1, that his parents, \"kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family.\" The author also states in paragraph @NUM2 that, \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance.\" Their are many mood set by the author of this memoir. But there is no doubt that he aimed for this memoir to be happy and uplifting and truely touching. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author uses words such as warm to describe things. \"Warm homes\" gives you a happy feeling @CAPS1 two gives you a happy mood overal. It makes you think about how happy the author is knowing they still have their family memories/skills.In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author using many words which set the mood of happiness, like \"warmth of kitchen, humble home, not just scent and music but life and love, gracious neighborhood, and simple house into a home. These choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood. The mood created by the author is warmth. First off, in paragraph two, it says how his family would always cook food and turn on the cuban music. It also says how the smell of the food would fill the house. In paragraph four, it says how they would always have family members over for dinner. Some of the family members they would have were Grandparents, Aunts, @CAPS1, and cousins. The last reason the mood is warmth is because he said in paragraph seven, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" That means that before they lived there, it was just three rooms; however, once they moved in, they turned it into a place where friends and family could gather and have fun. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a grateful and loving mood.Firstly, the author creates a grateful mood. He's grateful for his parents and how they sacrifice moving to @LOCATION2. They had to face racism. \"Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and racism prevailed in the United States.\" They wanted their son to have a good life. The author creates a grateful mood. Lastly, the author creates a loving mood. He feels a loving mood because his family love and take care of him. He considered his neighbors his family. \"My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" They loved many people who they knew they could trust. To conclude, the author creates a loving mood. In Narciso Rodriguez, his own memoir, his own memoir, we are told about his child hood. Narciso affects the mood by describing the setting. He writes \"could afford to into a modest three room apartment...\" in pharagraph @NUM1.  This gives you a humble feeling from the very beggining of the reading. In pharagraph @NUM2, he writes \"passionate Cuban music filled the air...\". This made me think of mexican culture. Narciso writes things like these throught his memoir. These lines give the mood of modesty and rich Cuban culture Narciso also writes about his birthday, and faimly. The parts that he writes about faimly give you a feeling of unity. These are the lines/phrases Narciso uses to give his memoir mood. In the memoir, the author creates a mood. The feeling, or mood, that I think that the author is trying to create is a very grateful mood. I say this because that author is talking about how he is grateful, or thankful, to his parents for teaching him things and for bringing him up in a home and neighborhood that was very united and close. The author created a sense of love and care in Narciso Rodriguez. The author talked about the sense of family and how people don't have to all be the same to become one community. In @CAPS2 @NUM1 it explains \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immagrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.\" @CAPS1 shared the feeling of acceptance because although they were all from different cultures and ethnicities, they all learned how to become one \"family\" in a rascist enviroment. @CAPS1 shared how his parents made the difficult decision to move to the new place leaving loved ones behind for their children's better future (@CAPS2 @NUM2). @CAPS1 showed a lot of admiration for his parents based on what they do for him and how they always have other family members or neighbors around the kitchen table for meals. In @CAPS2 @NUM3 @CAPS1 says \"There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and impressed upon me and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" The author shares his feelings of love toward his parents in this memoir. The mood that was created by the author is loving. It teaches the reader that the heart felted sacrifice and hardship the parents endured is priceless and the love that an immigrant family has for one another is endless. This mood explains the true definition of family and the unconditional, unfadeable love that a family has for one another and for its neighbor. This is true because in paragraph @NUM1 it tells the reader how grateful the author is for having such persistent, loving parents whose faith and determination for a better future taught the author how to love and appreciate the courage and strength one must have to overcome the struggles and barriers on this pursuit of happiness everyone is destined to follow. The mood of this memoir explains how precious is a home and the memories contained in it. This is the mood the author created in his memoir. The mood that's created by the author in the memoir is happiness but at the same time sadiness or to give up. Happiness is one mood because the author describes how his family has lived in @LOCATION2 (New Jersey) and how his family was not the only one to immagrate from their country. Their neighborhood is made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immagrants. The author has also made a few friends his first one being Alegria or the landlord's daughter. But the author did show some sadiness when he and his family had left Cuba. They had left friends, family, jobs and their country that they had loved. The author still listens to Cuban music when he does cook. The mood that the author sets is thankfullness. He is thankful for all the things, scarifices his parents had to for him. For example \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give thier children a better life, even thought it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" This is why the author wrote this memoir to thank his parents for what they did for him. In the memoir the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood of faith throughout the reading. As the author describes the parents moving into the United States, it tells how they had to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. The motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before. The author is very grateful as he admires his parents faith that has traveled so far over time. Rodríguez believes his parents have more courage then anyone and have expressed so much generosity upon him and others to always have their arms open to help others. It was the parents faith at the struggles would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. Reading this article expresses many different mood changing from the auther. While reading you can notice he's proud of his Cuban culter explaining how united his family has always been for as long as he can remember. Most important his so greatful to his parents for everything they've been through to see him sucuss in life and that's what I admire the most from the author. This story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture. He mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story. Like at the end when he says \"I learned the definition of \"family\", meaning his family was there for each other and and love was all over. This pasage made me realize everything my mother went through to see my brother and I success, so I can say I can relate to the auther. The author was speaking very proudly and happy about her parents. The author explained how her parents were very courageous and brave for leaving their home land. That's because neither of them spoke english. Also because they had to leave their lives back at home and start all over again. The mood in the memoir is happy. It is happy because it is a talking about Narciso's memories. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The mood is also appreciative. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says \"I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" The mood is also sad. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says \"But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. So there was several moods in this memoir. In this excerpt, Narciso Rodriguez describes his childhood home and extended \"family.\" The mood of this duration is very warm and happy. Narciso speaks of his childhood home with only love and affection. @CAPS1's eternally grateful to his parents for turning \"... this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 speakes admirably of his parents and the sacrifices and hard work they went through to even get to @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 is so thankful they did. @CAPS1 also speakes lovingly of his \"extended family\" and describes his neighborhood. \"In our neighborhood..., all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" This loving, supporting \"family\" made Narciso who is is today and made him appreciate the fact that \"' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" But instead is composed of those whom you love and who love you. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, Rodriguez created a mood of gratefullness toward his mother and father. Numerous times, he wanted to thank his mother and father. For example, \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance.\" @PERSON1 is so grateful for his parents because they left Cuba to start a new life in @LOCATION1. They sacrificed leaving their friends and family behind. In the text, it says, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life...\" His parents sacrificed so much just to give rodriguez a better life and thats why he creates the mood of gratefullness in his memoir. The mood the author created in the memoir is united, caring, loving and more. The authour is combining all of those moods together and memories to write this memoir, which is what a memoir is about; yourself, memories, family and etc. A reason why the author created does moods because a home is were a family live's together and were they hold memories together which shows loving. For example in the memoir, \"Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of a family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" Which is obviously the mood of loving, because there all a loving family together. A second reason why the author created does mood because in the place were the author lived there were many different people from different places. Even though they all werent the same the acted as a family and were united. For example, \"in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" which means that even though there different there going to be there for one another which is united. A third reason why the author created does moods because the author's parent's werent just caring for themselves but for others also just like their children. For example, \"They come selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life.\" Which means her parent werent just caring abalt them but the future for there son. The whole story is based on home and family but the thing is that a home and family will always share the love, caring and unity of one another. The mood of \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is @CAPS1 much the same throughout the whole excerpt.   In the story, the mood the whole time is calm and relaxed. Narciso talks about his family and how much he loves them and what they have done for him. It says in the story \"Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" @CAPS1 much throughout the story, this is the mood.       Another mood created by the author is gratefulness and thankfulness. Narciso is thankful to his parents selflessness. In the story, Narciso says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The way he talks about his parents ends up making the reader thankful too.     Narciso Rodriguez creates happy moods for us by the way he writes with love about his family and how he cares so much about what they did for him. The mood created by the memoir is thankful and proud. In paragraph @NUM1 it shows that he is thankful. \"... still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.) It also shows that Narciso Rodriguez is proud to be Cuban.In paragraph @NUM2, it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This also shows that Narciso is thankful for everything his parents did for him. Narciso also said that he often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance,In the last paragraph, it says that he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home. This shows that he is thankful for his parents. The mood created by the author in the memoir is in the following. In the first paragraph, it descripes a couple coming to @LOCATION2 from Cuba who settles down and has a baby. Within the story, it describes their life here in @LOCATION2, what their house is like and the importance of cooking and music from Cuba. In Newark, New Jersey this family invites friends and family for dinner and such; the author describes how it brought everyone together and the mood of unity and happiness. The mood of this memoir is happiness and unity which was created by the author. The autor created a good mood in the memoir because, when you think about how sticked those people were, you have a warm feeling inside.The parents left their country and came in another without any knowledge of her language and her culture, they had to start over their lives with the job they could find because they wanted a good life for their child. They handed a hand to people who were in need, considered all their neighbors as family and they taught their children the real definition of \"family\" The mood created in this memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives is a magnificent mood. A family move to the United States from Cuba so there @CAPS1 could have a better education. They have a nice home nice friends and a good and caring family. The neighbor, landlord, or friend Alegria makes them dinner some times. Also, they have friends that go over for dinner and often bring some food over with them. They have a family/friends that were Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people. They always had there door open for friend and family and most of there friend would go over every night. They would let people stay at there house if they needed help or if they had to rest. The mood was magnificent in this story. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood, that is overall cheerful, warm, and happy. He does this through his word choice. \"passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cookig that is still with me today.\" (par @NUM1). He decribes his parents cooking skills as \"rich\" and he describes his feelings toward cooking as positive. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people. \"all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" (par @NUM2). From this quote, you can tell that he has a very close relationship with all the people. Another example is when he says, \"always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love.\" (par. @NUM3). You can feel the warmth of the room with the adjectives he uses. This is how the author creates the mood in the story. In this memoir, the author touches upon serious facts while giving the memoir a fun and happy mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 they talked about how others who aren't even related to them come to do different activities with them, while still touching upon a serious topic about how his real grandparents weren't allowed to leave Cuba until 1970. The author also shows how even though they struggled and went through hardships in their home in the @LOCATION2, they were still able to keep their Cuban culture going along with the music they played and food. He portrays a mood that shows you can be happy no matter what the hardships you endure. The mood of the memoir from home: the blueprint of our lives is a grateful @ORGANIZATION1.Narciso tells the story about the way he grew up in @LOCATION1 raised by his Cuban parents. Narciso is very grateful that his parents had taught him to cook and introduced him to Cuban music which he loves. Narciso is @CAPS1 grateful for having parents who have given him much love and sacrifice. Narciso also admires his parents for their persaverence and strength. He has thanked them so many times but he can't show them how truly grateful he is of them. Throughout the memoir Narciso talks about his gratefulness which he sets the mood of grateful. In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to help the reader better relate to his life's story. The mood of this memoir is cozy in the beginning as he describes what his house was like and his own definition of family. As the memoir continues, the mood shifts to how grateful the author feels toward his parents. He describes how their selfless acts of leaving Cuba and creating a new life in @LOCATION1, helped create a strong foundation for him to grow up on. He says how his parents left behind their friends, family and jobs in the hope that their children would have a better life. His parents came to @LOCATION1, with no knowledge of the language and having to endure many hardships in finding and keeping jobs. The author says how he can't put his grateful feelings into words but is completely in their debt for taking such a big risk in coming to @LOCATION1. In the memoir, the author creates a specific mood to entice and interest the reader as they read more about his life. The mood the author created in the memoir was... him or herself expressing what it was like but then when something like that happened to them. Also he was explaining how he was really happy that their parent gave up everything in Cuba just to come be with their children, they Also didnt even know how to speak english when they first moved from cuba. So now pretty much their whole family lives close to eachother so they can all see eachother. Even if the parents can't find the jobs there looking for they were going to do whatever to make their family happy. Now that their family together They can spend the rest of there life happy together The mood created by the author. Is that @CAPS1 was talking about is that theres some families that come from every were and so Narciso Rodriguez is prowed of coming from Cuba.\"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowlege of the language or the culture. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. So thats what the mood of Narciso's story was like. The mood Narciso Rodriguez is trying to portray in this memoir is very relaxing and greatful. He wants to be able to show his readers that he is greatful for how his parents raised him and what type of enviornment it was. By reading this memoir one almost feels like they are at his house, surrounded by his friends and family. Narciso Rodriguez is also trying to show happyness, how he was happy with his life and always having friends around him. The mood created by the author of the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives is love. One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" This quote shows that even though they technically weren't family, they still loved eachother enough to be family. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 and it says, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" This quote shows that they love eachother more than anything. they are leaving behind and would do anything to give them better lives. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3 it says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This quote shows that for his parents loving him, he gives them love. That is the mood in the @CAPS1 Home: Blueprints of Our Lives. In the memoir the author has various moods. In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS1, \"In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family... my young parents created our traditional cuban home.\" The mood here is nuetral but kind of happy because the author is talking about her house. In paragraph @NUM2 it @CAPS1, \"They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.\" This mood is @CAPS2 because the author is talking about the parents hardships. Also, in paragraph @NUM3, it @CAPS1, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This also shows that the mood is happy because the author is grateful. These are the various moods that the author had in the memoir. The author creates a proud mood in the memoir. The author gives information about his background and how his parents were proud of it. Paragraph two states \"I was born into this simple house...my young parents created our traditional Cuban home...the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" Narciso's parents tired to influence as much as their Cuban heritage as they could. Narciso parents were always kind and loving to others. Paragraph four states \"My parents always kept their arms open and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" Though his parents didn't seem to have much money, they still housed others until they got back on their feet. Narciso parents worked hard knowing that they wouldn't get what they deserved. Paragraph five states \"The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved.\" His parents worked hard for what they worked for and no one can take that away. In conclusion, the author makes the reader feel praud for what Narciso's parents have done. The @CAPS1 in this memoir is joy and happiness. There is also caring and selflessness. This memoir describes how @ORGANIZATION1 grew up and his meaning of family. His family was very genorous to the people in their @CAPS2. On paragraph @NUM1 it says \"countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone Staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet\". His family was (seemed) very giving to their community. Because of Narciso's culture and family values, they have impacted his life today.Narciso parents were selfless. They would give up their living space to a friend who was having a hard time. They always had more then @NUM2 people at the dinner table and always more then @NUM2 people staying at their house. All these events have left Narciso Rodriguez with a sense of pride in his family and community. I think the author's mood was kind of like @CAPS1. I said that because as he was going along in the memoir at the end this statement is that his mom and dad turn a simple house into a home. That statement tells me that the author feels @CAPS1 well he is inside his home or inside a home with his family members. I Also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from. The mood is happy, proud, and grateful. Happy because he loved his family, his culture, and his home. \"In our neighborhood, dispite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso was proud and grateful to his parents because they gave up everything to come to the United States to give their family a better life. Without knowing alot about this new country, they struggled to overcome problems. Narciso is grateful to his parents for living their life to start over. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" In this excerpt from the book \"Home: the blue prints of our lives\" Narciso Rodriguez describes his first home in @LOCATION1. The feeling of this story is first loving with how @CAPS1 explains his parents sacrifice \"they-came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" This story also gave a feeling of closeness and how \"family had nothing to do with being a blood relative' @CAPS1 and his family opened up there house to many people. This story also gave a warm feeling by the story of his family celebrating together in paragraph seven. Overall the story had a happy mood to it showing love, kindness, and what a family should be like The mood created by the authar was warmthness. He was so @CAPS1 toward his family moving @CAPS2, he also cared for his parents alot and what they had done for their family. I know this because \"I will never forget how my parents turn to the simple house into a home\". In this memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives mood created is described. The starting evidence found in the memior is. \"my parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956.\" The mood being created is detirmenation. The parents were determined to make it to the United States because that was hard to do. But the parents did make it to the United States. The other piece of evidence found is \"in 1961, I was born into the simple house, situated in a two-family, blonde-brick building in the @CAPS1 bound section of Newark, New Jersey.\" The mood being created is happiness and sadness. There is happiness because he was just born. The sadness is that they couldn't go to the hospital and they live in a two-family house. This is the moods created in the memior. The mood in this memoir was soft, with an exception. I say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood that's really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care. It's also saying that there was racism and segragation, so in that paragraph (which is the exception) the mood is more of a rougher mood, I say rougher as in \"a rough life,\" having to deal with racism and segragation. Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the camunity helps out by sometines cooking neals. This was nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend). And also, how they would house family until they were back on their feet and having the feeling that their familly would do the same. for them. And lastly, the last sentence of the last paragraph gave the sense of them took a house and turned it into a home would be comforting. These all gives off the soft sense, meaning nice and thankful The mood in this memoir is happy and joyful. This child that is telling the story is telling about the happy things in their life. They tell about how they were born into a simple house. The heart of their home is the kitchen because they all love to cook. The family invites many people over to their home to have dinner. This child also talks about how greatful they are for their parents, and how the thanked them repeatedly. They will never forget how their parents turened their simple house into a home. So by these examples you can see that the mood of the memoir is happy and joyful. In this memoir there are many different moods that the auther tells you about. Happiness is a mood that the author tells you about. They are all happy because they can be together and have a grate time. Another mood is careing. her parents care about others and keep there doors open For them at all times. Love. Love is all around this house. They love all their Friends and Family and celebrate with then no matter what. They also show there love by leting people stay with them untill they can get back up onto there Feet. One mood in this memoir is courage, these two people show courage when they get here and they keep that Courage for a very long time. Expeshaly when they come from having such grate jobs to ones that arnt that great. In this memoir of the author creates a clear mood. He keeps stating over and over that he is so grateful of his parents and family members. Also, he describes that his house was always filled with amazing smells and cuban music. It also says that there was always a feeling of love and happiness in the air which sometimes pushed them through the hard times that they faced. Another thing that he says is that even though almost everyone has a different race, everyone got along and help others out. And one final way I know he had a happy mood, is that he said everyone was honest and hard working. The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were. In the last sentence of the memoir it reads, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This shows the reader that no house is a home without happy memories and great lessons learned. Narciso Rodriguez created a mood of happiness and comfort in the memoir. When he told that \"... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" it signaled to me that they all must be happy together. And when Rodriguez describes how all of the Cuban traditions his parents brought blended it just made me think he was comfortable with his home. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the excerpt from \"Home: The blueprints of our lives, is very thankFul. \"and for which I am eternally grateful\" \"I will always be grateful to my parents\" @CAPS1 like these that are scattered thro-ugh out the excerpt show greatfulness, and love for his parents. Some other @CAPS1 like \"They came selflessly\" and \"... To give their children a better life\". Throughout the excerpt he tries to express how greatful he is to his parents, and community. One quote that can to mind when reading paragraphs @NUM1 & @NUM2 is \"It takes a village to raise a child\" I think thats how @ORGANIZATION1's community worked. They weren't just neighbors, they were family. The moods created by the author in the memoir is happiness, love, and gratitude To start, it made me feel happy because of  the way he described his house, and how delightful it was. \"cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This quote made me visualize the scene, and I felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting. Secondly, it made me feel loving to my loved ones like my family and friends. \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,...\" I love my family, and would be thankful if they tried to take their home country to the United States (if they were born somewhere else) with them. Finally it makes me feel grateful to my own family, and friends. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" I would be grateful also. That is how this memoir makes me feel once I read it. The mood created by the author in the memoir is like a mellowish mood. Almost like a fun loving feeling. The author had literally put himself into the memoir as I read. Paragraph two, had used parentheses several times within the text. The parentheses had given the author's look into his reality. Which had helped to create a calm mellow feel. Over all the mood was fairley simple, fun. In the last sentence it stated that the author had said \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" It had basically described that the family did not have much, but made the best of what they did have. The last sentence had made the whole memoir have a calm mellowish feel. In conclusion, the author in the memoir had created a mellow feeling throughout the whole memoir. The memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" creates a very warm peaceful and interesting mood. The way the author described the way she used to live looks like she lived a very loving and peaceful enviroment. She also creates a spanish theme to it which I could relate to. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she says she is very passionate for Cuban music and she's grateful she know how to cook. She also said in paragraph @NUM2 she will never forget how her parents turned a simple house into a home. That quote makes the mood of the memoir loving. The mood in the memoir is gratefullness, happyness and remembrance.                                                                  Narciso is pround and thankfull of his parents, of them coming all this way by themselves and having to start their whole lives over \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" They came to @LOCATION1 \"to give their children a better life.\" They struggled, taking any job that they could find, They struggled for him, so he didn't have to struggle. Narcisco admires them for \"their strength and perseverance.\" Narciso sets the mood in the memoir as gratefulness to his parents and for all that they have done for him.                      He is happy with the life they have created for him, and is happy that they have done so well \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.                                                                                                       Narciso is happy and grateful for his life that he was given by his parents. The mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The author creates gratefulness by repeatedly saying what his parents gave him and that he is grateful for it. First he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" This shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking. Another time the author is grateful is in paragraph @NUM2. It says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This shows the author is grateful for his parents' endurance to come to @LOCATION1. In conclusion, the mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. He was grateful for his parents giving him all they could. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\", tells us of how @CAPS1 grew up with his parents who which immigrated from Cuba, the mood created by the author is warm & comforting.For example, the mood is comforting because, @CAPS1 speaks of how, his parents created a traditional Cuban home, out of nothing but a one bedroom apartment. @CAPS1 descrbes his life being centered around the kitchen & his parent always provideing what they could the best for him.\"@CAPS1 also states \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrafice\". Ive often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could ever have done\". The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy. It made me feel happy because it was good to know that \"'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This meant that all the people around you that care about you are your \"family\". Another reason why the mood of the memoir is happy is because I think if my parents were in the same situation that Narciso's parents were in, my parents would have done the same thing. My parents would have also wanted, \"to give their children a better life.\" @CAPS1 this memoir makes me feel happy because of how caring Narciso's parent's were. In the memoir \"@PERSON1\" by @PERSON1 a mood is created throughout the story. Mood is a feeling displayed to the reader through literature. In this particular piece the mood was proud and festive. @PERSON1 creates this mood by using various words and phrases. First @PERSON1 said, \"my parents created our traditional Cuban home\" This shows his family's pride because thier house looks like it did in Cuba. Also, the theme was festive because @PERSON1 describes the large parties and dinners that were constant at his home. Third, @ORGANIZATION1 creates a festive mood when he wrote, \"My parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate thier arrival to this country\" This quote creates a festive theme because his family all enjoyed partying with others. In conclusion the memoir \"@PERSON2\" there was a theme of festivity and pride through out this whole piece of literature. In this memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, there was only one @LOCATION1 mood I think. The mood I think the author was trying to make people feel is happiness. There are a lot of examples that make me think that. One example that I think is best is the last sentence \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" I think this is the best example of happiness because even though they didn't live in the biggest house, the were still happy with what they had. That is what I think the mood created by the author was. The mood created in \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez is a profound sense of closeness and selflessness that so enriched Narciso's childhood. The mood created by Narciso comes from his memoir, in which he lived a poor life, but a life that was enriched by friends and family that had a very close bond, one that overcame racism and tough time. \"all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\"      The mood created by Narciso displays how his community acted, and shows how close is friends and family were. It is a mood that helps readers understand Narciso's community.       The mood created by Narciso is also one of selflessness, as Narciso describes his community as one of \"honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily of their own kind, were clearly in need.\"       @CAPS1, Narciso creates a mood of closeness and selflessness. @PERSON1 is a short story about a boy who is very grateful & shows a lot of appriciation torwards his parents. He feels that he is at home even though he moved to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 it said his parents created his new home to look like a cuban home he had back in cuba by putting cuban thing on the wall. I feel that in this short story he is very grateful because he said in paragraph @NUM2 he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house to a home. @PERSON1 is a very calm and happy short story. Narciso Rodriguez loves his family and home very much. In his memoir, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made and how truly grateful he is that his parents moved to New Jersey for a better life for themselves and him, no matter what the cost. His memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them. He really wants people to be able to feel to happiness that he feels when he thinks about his home and his wonderful life that his parents provided for him. He realizes his luck and therefore his memoir is very upbeat and shows that even in hard times, you can live life to its full extent. In this memoir, there is more than one mood. There is love, friendship, and happiness Narciso expresses love for her parents and friends in paragraph @NUM1. \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" The author is saying that everyone comes toge-ther and that they all care for eachother. She expresses friendship in parag-raph @NUM2. When she says that her babysitter was her first friend. Finally, she expresses happiness. In paragraph @NUM3, when she is saying \"she will never forget how her parents turned this simple house into a home. You could tell that she is happy, and grateful for her parents. Those are a @CAPS1 moods in the memoir. The mood of the excerpt is very bright. The author describes her risk taking, loving parents. The author describes the many things her parents have given to her. \"Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today... Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.\"     As you can see, the author. Narciso Rodriguez, describes her young life and home with happiness and greatfullness. This is all generously spoken within the depths of the excerpt. Many authors enjoy using these tones to express their own personal feelings and opinions about the matter. In this case, the author wanted to express joy in her writing. The author created a very grateful/happy mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 when Narciso says \"I will always be greatful to my parents for the love and sacrifice. When he is saying this he is showing he is happy w/ his parents. I the memoir he talks about how he loves his house and why he loves his house and all the great memories in that house and that shows that this memoir mood is a more happy mood instead of sad for example paragraph @NUM2 when he says \"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house were a cuban feast always filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love.\" Also when he said in paragraph @NUM2 that\" It here where i learned the real defenition of family. And for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love. The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy. I think there is hapiness because of what it says on paragraph @NUM1. \"In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in a great solidarity and friendship.\" @CAPS2 that mean that there were a happy and friendly family. In conclusion, that's the mood I think the @CAPS1 created and some reasons why. The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life. He also sounded grateful when he talked about the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other. He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of \"family\" while living in that house. By \"family\" he didn't mean blood relative Family. What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful. This memior created a warm, touching mood while he explained his childhood. I espicially think the part when he said \"Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and  endless celebrations that encomposed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\", because it shows an overall perspective on a normal day during his childhood. Also, where he states that family \"has nothing to do with being a blood relative really makes his memior interesting because it is also teaching lessions.All in all, this memior was great, and the warming mood is something that I won't forget, and I hope that I too too can write a memior such as heart-warming and interesting as this one. The moods created by the author in the @CAPS2 were grate ful because of all the things that the parents did for their child. Friendly because they have \"family\" in the United states, and they Kept their arms, and door open for their \"family\". Also they had Courage because they didn't give, trying to learn the language, and finding a job. The last @CAPS1 that this @CAPS2 had was from paragraph seven, happiness, the chid has many memories of his/her Cuban heritage, Still listens to Cuban music, and was born and raised in the united states. The mood of the author is a very gental yet very happy tone. The reason it's gental is because he's describing how he grew up and what his life was like. To some people, they could just blab all day, but to most they have to dig through memories so that they can get the sceen just right. For example, \"Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.\"     @CAPS1 the parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail. For example, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today.\" The reason that he could remember this more clearly is because he probably cooks for his family using his parents resipies. The mood created by the author in this memoir is deffinitty being proud. The reason I think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life. Also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, to being a famous fashion designer. Lastly, this memior's mood also seems proud because he says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1, the author makes him seem proud of himself. In \"@PERSON1\" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as \"aromas,\" \"endless,\" \"encompassed,\" \"instilled,\" etc. This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like \"(and for which I am eternaly grateful)\" and \"(which I adore to this day)\" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating \"I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice.\" The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. As a result the mood of \"@PERSON1\" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the authors choice of words and statements. That is why I would describe the mood of \"@PERSON1\" as being very passionite and full of gratitude. The memoir's mood is a sense of happiness because its talking about a place where neighbors are like family and everyone is very close. Like how Sergio and @PERSON1 became his surrogate grandparents, when they were people who lived in the basement appartment. Alegria, his first friend normally ate dinner with them. The whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors. The overall mood created by the author of this memoir is one of complete gratefulness. The author is very, extremely thankful for his parents sacrifice, love, care and selflessness. He also creates a mood of happiness, unity and overall loving, that he has seen throughout his lifetime. The author describes his gratefulness towards his parents by remembering how they had to leave cuba, their native country, friends, family and jobs behind because they wished to give the child they wished for better life opportunities that could only be found in @LOCATION1. He thanks his parents repeatedly throughout the memoir for the love, caring, family, friends and selflessness they brought into his life. He describes situations where his parents had to make new friends and family from around their neighborhood and that from that a sense of love and friendship and unity was found. As his family got larger, the author talks about how his childhood, small, three-room apartment was made into a completed home. When all of these details combined, along with language such as. \"I've thanked them repeatedly,\" a mood and feeling of utter gratefulness is felt throughout the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\". The mood created by the author was a very grateful and happy mood in his memoir. For an example in paragraph six he states \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their Love and sacrifice.\" This shows how grateful he is to his parents. He is also grateful to his friends and neighbors it states this in paragraph three when the author says \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" This shows that Narciso Rodriguez is very neighborey and that his neighbors portray the same happy, grateful, and neighborely outlook. so all of these reasons explain the mood of Narciso Rodriguez. In the memoir \"@PERSON1\" by @PERSON1 he describes the mood. The first thing is that the mood is love. For starters he says \"growing up in this envionment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Over here, he is saying that your friends can be your family or the people that you love. Secondly he says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Right here, he is saying that he thanks his parents for the life they had given him. Finally, he says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Here he is saying that \"he will never forget when he was living in a home with family, In conclusion @PERSON1 rodriguez describes the mood but also his childhood When he learned about family. The mood created by the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says \"Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with a blood relative.\" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference. In the memoir the mood that the author created is the memoir can be @CAPS1 in two ways. first was happy for being created and being able to use america's beautifulfriendlyness. \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to a blood relative.\" @CAPS2 was that knowing that if you have hope anything can be achived. \"I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. In this memoir author creates a very specific mood that is the Same throughout the memoir. The mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood. One way that this mood was @CAPS1 was that they talked how their enviorment Showed a great sense of family and when I think of family I see the mood as comforting and happy. \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative\". This showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed @CAPS2 reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met. \"It was a close nit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were Clearly in need\". This is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood. The mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lave. An example from the text says \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers in the country they loved .\" @CAPS1 example from the text says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them my admiration for the strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" In conclusion because of his parents love for him they sacrificed alot, so he could have a happy and good life.  The mood Created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy. The reason I say that because if my parents did that I should be very grateful because they did all this for me to be happy and for me to have a better life. \"And for which I am eternally grateful\". \"They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life\". Wow that @CAPS1 alot from his/her parents they are very strong and they did all for their children to be happy. This is the reason why I picked those two mood in the memoir! The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 says \"here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.\" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir. The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. How the parents turned the \"simple house\" into the \"traditional Cuban home\" was shocking. The parents played the \"Passionate Cuban music.\" and \"a love of cooking\" helped create a family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage. \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relitave. This family loved spending time w/ eachother, and celebrating. Over all, the mood is loving, happy, and caring. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 created a certain mood. Narciso Rodriguez created a gentle mood that stayed constant. @CAPS1 tells how his parents \"always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family.\" Which means @CAPS1 probably grew up in a life without very much violence. @CAPS1 also says that @CAPS1 \"will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 wants his parents to know that @CAPS1 loves them very much and lets them know by thinking them. Lastly @CAPS1 @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 \"will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" The sense of gentleness stays throughout the whole memoir because @CAPS1 is always saying the good things about his life, not the bad. The mood Created by the @CAPS2 in the memoir was happy. First thing @CAPS1 the mood is happy Of this memoir is when the @CAPS2 wrote \"Passionate Cuban music (which I dore to this day)\" that meant that @CAPS3 really love her Culture music. Another thing is when @CAPS3 said \"Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, And for that true you dont have to be related to someone who really love to say that he/@CAPS3 is @CAPS5 of your family is Just enoght that he/@CAPS3 love and care about you like you for he/@CAPS3. Last thing is when the @CAPS2 said \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, that meant that @CAPS3 will never Forget that her family began so small And then turn big because their family went to their house and they stared their new life in the house. The author was @CAPS2 likely describing his happy @CAPS1. Because in the memair it was talking about how he loved his home and his parents Cooking and music. He was @CAPS2 grateful for his parents caring and selflessness. He liked how his home was a community for Spanish, cuban, and italian immagrants. He thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts and it made him happy. This is my summary of Narciso Rodriguez's mood of the story. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso says, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,\" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez,\" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optomistic man. The mood described by the author in the memoir is a greatful and happy feeling I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, Always brings up how he is greatful for his partents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, \"At tine when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great soidarity and friendship.\" Even though there is racism, @CAPS1 one is friends. The overall mood in Narciso's memoir is admiration and gratefullness towards his parents. He expresses his gratitude several times. Like on paragraph @NUM1. It says \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.\" @CAPS1 all of paragraph @NUM1 is about how grateful he is to his parents. Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done\" Also all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his admiration towards his parents. So, the mood @CAPS1 in the memoir was love, towards his parents.  In the non--fiction memoir \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso talks about his life growing up, his home, and the people around him. The author considered his neighbors family also, rather than just his parents and brothers and sisters. \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... a close knit community.\" (par @NUM1) This gives the memoir a friendly mood, it shows that the author loved his whole neighborhood. The author also invited his neighbors into his home and was very close to them. \"Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table... more often than not. Also at the table... my surrogate grandparents.\" (par @NUM2) This gives the memoir an inviting mood, the author always had friends and neighbors over for dinner. The author also talks about how grateful he is for his parents. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" (par @NUM3) this gives the memoir a sweet mood, the author shows his happiness and gratefulness for everything his parents had done for him. In conclusion the authors  sets a very sweet, inviting mood, by adding details of how joyful, and enjoyable his childhood was. The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort. The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The author was explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and felt. The boy thought that his parents were really great and he thought that he could never be like them. He was also grateful that he had house and parents like you did. He admired his parents and what they did. He will never forget growing up and living in that house. The purpose of the author was to show you how grateful someone was of what there parents did when they immagrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. There was a mood created by the author in @CAPS1 memoir. Here are some points to help support this parenthesis identify a new mood, his gratefulness, and his view on things. First, parenthesis identify a new mood. When it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back. Here is my reason why the story, \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen.\" @CAPS2, his gratefulness. @CAPS1 is very grateful for how things turned out. Here another reason why from the story. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS3, his view on things. @CAPS1 had very fortunate times in his eyes. Ultamately these were my reasons for the mood that was created by the author parenthesis, gratefulness, and his perspective. Narciso Rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. He is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: \"I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done.\" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: \"they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.\" In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful. I believe that the mood created by the author is happy and loving. In paragraph @NUM1 it states \"Growing up in the enviorment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" @CAPS1 not only the people blood related to your is your family but also friends and anyone close to you. The excerpt also states \"It was in this simple house that my parents welcome other refugees to celebrate their arival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays.\" This shows the love that everyone has for one another. Lastly the excerpt states \"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family.\" This part makes you feel warm and happy about family. People make sacrafices for the ones they love. That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. They left their family and friends to give their son a better life. The author makes an enjoyable and heartwarming mood.Narciso is very greatful. He said he has \"learned the definition of 'family' \". His parents wanted a better life for him. They gave up a lot and he recognize that. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. \"I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons. Put others before yourself, and work hard. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives has a happy mood. The author talks about \"passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen\" In paragraph @NUM1 which makes the house seem very happy and joyful. In paragraph @NUM1 the author also says \"within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home the very heart of our kitchen\" this makes the author seem very happy since they like to cook. Narciso Rodriguez talks about \"it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and @CAPS1 celebrated my first birthdays\" the mood here seems that everybody liked to come to this house. This whole memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" makes the mood seem very happy and warm. The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and/or thankfull mood. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their \"family\". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him. The mood created by the memoir is shown by many things. Through positive words, often mentioned thankfulness, and a cosy setting, a happy positive mood is shown. Positive words are oftem mentioned in the article for example it @CAPS1 \"It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people,\" in this the words honest, hardworking, and the pease \"extended a hand,\" (which means offered help) all invoke a happy mood. The authors constant thanking of things, like as the memoir states \"(and for which I am eternally thankful)\", gives a happy mood because people are only thankful for positive things. Finally this positive mood is shown through setting, which sounds happy and is described as nice. as the memoir @CAPS1 \"within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.\" This descibtion of the setting shows a clear happy cosy, positive mood. The mood created by the memoir is happy, positie, and nice because the memoir is worded with positve words, has often mentioned thankfulness, and has a nice setting. Before reading about @PERSON1 I don't think I read about anyone who is more happy than @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is very happy about being an @CAPS1 citizen and still be very happy of having another country's background (in this case Cuba). @PERSON1 was blessed that he had his house. It was in a great neighborhood and the kitchen was the main place of the house. @PERSON1 was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house. @PERSON1 was very happy about his parents, most of all. Without his parents he would have lived in Cuba and would not have known his great neighborhood and all of his family and friends. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he thinks the definition of \"family\" is. He is very specific in that he believes \"family\" doesn't mean blood relatives, \"family\" is about friends and family coming together to form a community. Where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect. He sets a very specific mood in this memoir which is everyone coming together. That sense of happiness and fullness one might get after doing something good for someone else. Narciso Rodriguez talks about how his dinner table is alway full of family and sometimes friends. That his family's door is always open to people who need help. When you read his memoir, you really understand what \"family\" really is. The feeling of love, open-ness, willingness, and happiness. you get helping other people and being around people you love and who love you. The mood Narciso Rodriguez sets in this memoir is very powerful in that it really makes people stop and think. In the memoir the author creates a happy mood. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he enjoyed and is thankful for from his childhood. He does this by talking about how his kitchen table was surronded by his \"family\". Or as he say \"countloss extended family members cane and went.\" This shows that there were always people around. He also says how he is thankful for how his parents came to the @LOCATION1 \"to give their children a better life\". Finally he says he is greatful to his parents \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrife.\" @CAPS1 in the memeor the author creates a happy modd by talking about his childhood surronded by family and thankes his parents for there sacrifeces they made to give him a betters life. The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had. One example is when he says \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" To me that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. That is why I think the mood is love. The memoir Narciso Rodriguez from The blue prints of our lives, there is a mood. The mood is very happy and positive and friends and family like, for example they just moved from cuba away from family just for his better life. Also it very helping and sellflly becuse even though ther friends and family were in cuba to parnts moved to New Jersey for a new lif for the kide and make a home. this is the mood of the memoir Narciso Rodriguez. In this memoir, the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood. The author talked about how family isn't about blood, and how a house doesn't have to be spectacular to be a home. The authors said in the memoir \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, created a great place to live. The mood also very hopefull. This is because the author's parents came to america with nothing, but with all their hard work, they over came their struggles and helped everyone else in their neighborhood. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were. In this memoir by @PERSON1 he sets the overall mood for his \"definition of family\". Rodriguez's parents or Cuban immigrants and they live in a community full of all differen ethinic groups. \"Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants\" form their community. The Rodriguez famly whas enormouse and their doors where open to any one who needed assistance. The table was allways full for dinner at their house. The mood set was one of very kind and helpfull personalities. Families are bigger than just \"blood relatives\" they are the people who you care about and help, or who help you. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. In this memoir the author creats a mood of grattitude. To support a claim like this I will provide evidence. It says in the article that \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. This clearly shows how the author is trying to creat a mood of gratitude. His gratitude is being showed towards his parents. Also it says that They came selflessly as many immigrants do to give there children a better life. This shows how the family leaves there comfort to a troublesome life for there children, thus making the children very greatful. The mood created by the author is gratefullness and is shown throw out the whole memoir. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez,\" the author creates a mood. First, The author shows feelings in this part \"My parents both shared cooking duties and un wittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. The author shows a feeling of a warm, wonderful household with music and cooking. Next, the author shows a feeling of a nice warm child hood here: \"Here, the innocence of child hood, the congregation family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" The author enjoyed a nice childhood, filled with friends and family, all enjoying the wonders of their home. That is how the author sets the mood. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and loving mood. It sets a loving mood whe the author says, \"Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood realitive.\" This sets a loving mood because the author is pretty much saying that a person can be so close to you and love you that you consider them family even though you are really not even related. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, \"They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" This quote shows that Narciso's parents love their children so much that they wanted them to have better lives and to be happy. That is the mood created by the author in this memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. Here are some points to consider. First of the mood of the author is I think greatfulness. For example \"(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day). second of all the mood of the author is appreciation. For example \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 I think another mood of the author is definitely love. I kno this because he talks about love and his family and friends alot. For example \"I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. In conclusion the authors moods can be described in many different ways. The mood created in this memoir is happy and warm. It starts by talking of things Narciso learned in the home. The Cuban music \"which I [Narciso] a door to this day.\" As well as the culinary skills, \"I am eternally grateful.\" Narciso is happy, therefore the mood is happy.Also, Narciso talks about the grat community. \"It was a close -knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand...\" Narciso goes into great detail describing the good things, like the community. The author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants including her parents. \"They came selflessly... to give thir children a better life.\" Narciso Rodriguez describes many positive effects of her parents as immigrants. As a result of the positivity, a happy mood is created. Based on the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\", by Narciso Rodriguez, I believe that the @CAPS1 is trying to re-create his/her past in a way that teaches the reader a few important life lessons about home and family, such as \"It was here I learned the real meaning of family, and that you can turn a simple house into a home.\" In this excerpt \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez is a sad story. The mood the author is putting sad and happy stories at the same time. One example is when his parents left from Cuba for his son's own sake for a better place. His parents had great jobs in Cuba. His mother was a Chemical @ORGANIZATION1. and his father worked in a labratory. \"In Cuba @PERSON2,had worked in a laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering.\" The author's mood of this story is sad. In the memoir of \"Narciso Rodriguez\" there are two contradicting moods. From chapters one to six Narciso said \"that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship\" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez describes in-depth as well. He mentioned Cuban cooking and music, not a single detail was left out. There was so much happiness and bliss at the beginning, but it's soon faded as Narciso spoke of his parents. Narciso's parents, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, both sacrificed their lives to live in @LOCATION1. \"In @ORGANIZATION1 and Maria worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in @LOCATION1.\" They would take any job they could find. This mood quickly fades away as Rodriguez describes his gratefulness to his parents. Narciso is very lucky to have parents like @PERSON2 and Maria to watch over him. According to the memoroir the mood created by the author is he is thankful for everything his parents have gave him. For example, he states in paragraph @NUM1 \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\"Narciso always told his parents how greatful his is for them. But Narciso says \"But in reality there is no way to express my gratitude.\" The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is showing all kinds of memories the family has at one house As it says in the memoir, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. It's saying that a house is a house and it doesn't mean much to people and anyone can go there. But a home is where you live, is where you grow up and have all the memories, it's just a better place In the memoir \"@PERSON1\" by The Blueprints of Our lives, the mood created by the author is happyness.The mood in the memoir was happyness. It because the mother showed he how to love people. Quote she said... Always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love. It was there I learned the real difinition of \"family.\" That many family is just not the people you love and not being a blood relative. I like when her mom let anybody to there household to the table.In the mood that created by the author is happyness in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez. In the excerpt \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso Rodriguez create a feeling of mood about their home life. Narciso talk about life at home and about his parents cooking. He is greatful for his parents cooking and how he learned from them. In paragraph three it states \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" This shows that he considered people around him family and not just his blood relatives. He shows this by talking about how his surrogate grandparents lived in the basement and he didn't know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba. He is always grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. The whole memoir is about love, family which sets a positive mood for the reader. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very touching. the memoir explains how as a kid he didnt have much growing upas a kid but he did have family and he was extreamly greatful and proud of his parents for their efforts to start a new family in a different country without knowing the languge. When I hear about someone being that @CAPS1 it makes me think how times have changed from whe Narciso was growing up in the @NUM1's. He was so greatful and happy when compaired to now he has nothing. But he was abel to show all his gratude with the deepest heart warming simpathyall in all @CAPS2 learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing you can have. This memoirs mood is fairly consistent throughout the whole piece. This story is about how @PERSON1 parents created a home. His parents put love, unity, kindness and happiness in their home. He is thanking his parents for being brave and coming to @LOCATION1 with little and creating a foundation for their future life. He's thanking them for making their simple house into a loving home. The mood of this piece is graciousness and happiness. He is gracious towards his parents for being courageous and making them a home. Durring this piece he is happy that his parents were brave and came to @LOCATION1, that is why this memior also has a happy mood. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very loving and carring mood.                                                         Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez can't stress enough how much love, greatfulness, and respect @CAPS1 has towards his parents. For example in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso Rodriguez says \"I will always be greatful for their love and sacrifice\", meaning the sacrifices parents made for their children. @CAPS1 also says \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseference... but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit and generosity...\" @CAPS1 cares about the lessons his parents taught him so much, that @CAPS1 bases his life on them and will never forget them. But perhaps the most important thing Rodriguez says in this memoir is in paragraph @NUM2, when @CAPS1 says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This somes up everything his parents taught and sacrificed for him. giving this simple sentence a great meaning. The author created a mood that showe his true love for his family and his home by explaining his culture, his family, and how grateful he is to his parents. He starts by going into detail about his culture of \"Rich culinary skills....a love of cooking....passionate cuban musci (which I adore to this day)\" it builds a base to this mood by showing that his home was always filled with the food and arts of his heritage.  He goies on to talk about his family, which \"had nothing to do with being a blood relative,\" he explained how his true family was of many many cultures that \"came together in great solidarily and friendship.  \"@CAPS1, he thanks his parents for everything they did for him by moving to @LOCATION1 and for showing him how important family and friends are.  \"i will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home.\"  That is the mood expressed by the quthor, through his culture, family, and by showing gratitude to his parents for giving him a basis for life.  In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the other. This mood is a mix of many things. Love, generosity, and greatfulness. The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner.                                                                  The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author.                                                                                                                                                    The author says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\"                                  The mood in this memoir is created by the people and family who live there, and go there. The mood  in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful. One way how @CAPS1 shows this is @CAPS1 says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life.Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were.The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. \"I've thanked them repeatedly\" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir was graditude.The author was feeling graditude because he was thankful for what his parents have done for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This lines says that the author is grateful that his parents sacrificed a lot for the author to have a better life.He was also feeling gratitude because his parents' generosity helped him demonstrate how important family and friends are. In paragraph @NUM1 it also says, \"But, in reality, there is no way to express my graditude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" This lines explains the graditude he has cannot measure up to what his parents showed him.In conclusion, the mood created by the author in the memoir was graditude. The mood of the memoir is love. @PERSON1 and his family \"... always kept their arms and their door open to the many people (they) consider family, knowing that they would do the \"same for (them)\" (@NUM1). Even though\"(thier) nieghorhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States\" (@NUM2) they all cared for each other as if they were one family. Prior to moving to the United States, \"Narciso, Sr., had worked in the laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studed chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start thier lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find\" (@NUM3). They moved to the United States, leaving their good jobs, so that thier son could live a better life Narciso doesnt take this for granted. He engulfs the in a profusion of thanks. Throughout the memoir the author costantly writes about all the caring and love in the lives of @PERSON1 and his family. The mood that the author shows is happiness and love. In the memoir he talks about his mom and dad coming to the @PERSON1 without fear and not knowing anything abot the language or culture. Also he talks about when the rest of his family comes his mom and dad lets them in with open arms and when someone needs help to stand back on their feet. The parents were happy about what they did and who they loved. The mood of the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy and grateful a quote for being grateful is is paragraph @NUM1. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\". The mood created by the author in the memoir is very warm with lots of love. The author explains how him growing up in his environment had showed him that \"family\" didn't necessarily mean blood relative. Everyone in his neighborhood came together in \"great solidarity and friendship.\" Whatever family members had went to the authors home, his parents would take them in no matter what because they knew if they were in the same situation they would be welcomed also. So for that they always kept their arms and door wide open to people they considered family. The author also mentioned that he would always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice and how important family and friends are. So in conclusion, the mood was warm and loving because he learned the real meaning of \"family\" and how he learned about how to love. The mood in the memoir is very happy. Narciso Rodriguez, the main character and young cuban boy, describes some hardships such as his \"parents not able to get the right jobs\" or \"facing cultural hardships.\" @CAPS1 Narciso talks about all the good things that happened. Such as his friend and babysitter, Alegria, made him feel great, or how his parents gave him the love of cooking. One thing Narciso will never forget his parents love and sacrifice. His parents always allowed family members to come and stay. Sometimes just to help them get back on their feet. The mood in which the author includes in the memoir is described her Narciso Rodriguez. The mood described in this memoir is mostly about love, unity, and culture. In love he shows that his parents immigrated mostly to give his children a better future. This is described in paragraph @NUM1.In unity it shows that in their neighborhood most of the immigrants were always having feasts and being really close to each other. This is explained in paragraph @NUM2 where it says, \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\". His parents taught him how to cook food from his country and also to dance to Cuban Music as it says in paragraph @NUM3. These are the types of mood described in the memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy, and loving his life.First of all, the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Here is a quote from the text. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.\"@CAPS1, the mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. Here is evidence from the article. \"A Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.\"@CAPS2, the mood created by the author in the memoir is loving his life. Here is a quote from the article. \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\"In conclusion, my main point here is to show you how joyful Narciso is. The mood created by the author in the memoir is the begining of the memoir he tells how his parents had a hard time coming to another country and having to deal with allot of problem and the mood is really sad or with allot of suspense and by the middle of the memoir he talks about how he grown up in a family that everbody was so happy and live most everbody together and they had allots of feast and that mood changed to a more happy mood or joyfull mood that he had with his family, and by the end he talks about he thank his parents for the person that he is and all the opportunities they give him and that change the mood to a thankful mood or a grateful mood. And that is how the author creates all the moods on the memoir. The mood created by the author was mostly happiness and thankfulness. Narciso's parents came to the @LOCATION1 with courage without any knowledge of the language nor culture. Narciso feels thankful and graceful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the designer is happy. He explained about how peaceful and grateful his... life with his \"family\" was by keeping is Cuban culture and heritage. The author said that the sense of family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. For paragraph @NUM1 and @DATE1, the mood was pretty sad because Narciso described what hardships his parents had to go through to come to the @LOCATION1. He said I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the author describes how much he honors his parents such as how they not only told him life lessons but also showed him. Narciso Rodriguez ended the story with a happy mood by stating he loves his parents for everything they have done for him overall, this memoir had a variety of different moods at certain times depending on what the author was talking about. But mostly, the author was GRATEFUL. The mood created by the author was to me appreshiation, and some sympathy. Heres @NUM1 people that gave up their home, job, family, friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have lots of appreshiation because its just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best fer us. I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story. The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism, the freinds still found ways to make them all happy and all got a long. Another fond memory he re-calls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in cuba but moved to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. This taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true deffinition of family. The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a caring, happy, and thoughtful mood. By mentioning the Cuban traditions shared in the neighborhood between close friends, and cooking in the kitchen to share a great meal with one another the mood is happy. When Narciso talks about the great friends he made from different heritages and knowing the entire community like family the mood is thoughtful and caring because it shows that the people really appreciated each other's company. It is also caring in the story when Narciso talks about how his parents devoted their lives to making sure that their children and the people they knew had good lives to. When Narciso describes the way his parents struggled during the cold winters, yet they always let others in, shows a very caring mood in the memoir. I also think that the fact that a small, simple apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it several times. I think he does this to show a thoughtful for mood, in that the house was small but through creativity in bringing culture in made it seem much bigger. The mood created by the author was one of happiness, love, and caring. Not only does it show in his style, but the author also gives details that really create the vibe. In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes the food as \"rich culinary skills and love of cooking,\" and the music as \"passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This creates a homely affect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many \"family members\" that came over for meals. The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked hard to get where they were for the faith that their children would have a better life than they had. With all of the details, the author creates a loving, cultural affect can only be found with great family and friends. Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life. The author creates a mood that he is very greatful to his parents. His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, (wich he loves to cook). \"(and for wich I am eternally greatful).\" His main greatfullness, is of their love and sacrifise. They would take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, wich he found amazing. \"I will allways be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" And he is not affraid to let them know, \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repetedly.\" @CAPS1 the memoir, the auther creates a mood that he is greatful to all his parents love and sacrifices, not only to himself, but to everyone they've helped. I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness made up of many different moods. The other moods are reminisceance and hapiness. Thankfulness is focused on in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Narciso Rodriguez talks about thankful he is his parents gave up so much to come to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were. He showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like. Lastly happiness which is mostly his mood when he remineses his past and family. Those are the moods of his meimor. In this memoir about @PERSON1 the reader learns alot about the @CAPS1 by the mood (or tone) of the memoir. The mood of this memoir is greatful, because he is thinking of all the opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless.     In the memor the reader learns that parent makes so many sacrifices for their children that helping around the house and thanking them is the least they can do.      In conclusion the mood in the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is, happy, and greatful because of the sacrifices made by his parents. A good citation for this is \"even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" The author creates a loving, and caring mood. He makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms. That if you are feeling down they would pick you right up with a warm meal and a cozzy bead. He describes that they left Cuba to come to the land of oppertunities. That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, it gives a cheery, happy safe mood. Paragraph @NUM1 explains a traditional cuban home, with the cooking and music and everything. It's like that in my house, just with @CAPS1 things, not Cuban. Also, the narrator explains how everyone in the neighborhood was a close - knit family of Cuban, spanish and Italian people. No one would hurt one other and every one will help in case of a problem, giving a safe feeling. Lastly, All of paragraph @NUM2 and @NUM3 explains how his parents risked everything to be in the @CAPS2. My parents did the same thing and it makes me feel happy that they did. So, its probably the same for the narrator. In conclusion, the memoir has a good and happy mood to it. the mood created by the author in the memoir was mutule in the begining it was about move to a New contrey they did seem faced by it they were more into giveing there child a better life and in the end it really sounds like they were all happy they welcomed people that moved from somwhere els into there home and welcomed them I think overall it was a happy mood that was created by the author The mood created @CAPS1 the author in the memoir was grateful and loving. In one of the paragraphs, Narciso said, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.\" @CAPS1 saying this, @CAPS2 is saying that @CAPS2 is grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him. @CAPS2 said that @CAPS2 learned the real definition of \"family.\" @CAPS2 knows that members in a family would give up anything to help another member of the family. @CAPS2 also said, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" His family helped create a good home with love. I think the overall mood created by the author, is comfort. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, \"Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like.Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, \"Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.\" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong. Paragraph @NUM3 is all about how much the author cares about his parents and is very grateful to them. the comforting sense of a home is very important to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also his very large family. The @CAPS1 is writing in first person narrative. The @CAPS2 sets a tone with and about How he is so proud of his cuban relationship and haritage. He is also very happy and proud about how he has great parents and a great house and very very fund memories of all these things. He also explains and talks about other people and how it was hard to leave cuba and come to america. That is how the @CAPS1 sets the tone for this story. A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trails, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family is, that its much more than blood. It's unity, friendship and laughter, its the tears, pain and heartache. Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it to, I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family. The author in this memoir created a mood that showed how @CAPS1 felt about this house and his parents. He appreciated the house and was grateful for his parents. He is grateful for his parents and for their love and sacrifice. He is grateful they love and care for him. He says, \"I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance.\" @CAPS1 appreciates this house and how his parents made it into a home. He appreciates how his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family.So in this memoir the author created a mood that showed greatfulness and appreciation. The author of this memoir put a mood to it. The mood of this is very loving, because the parents gave everything to make their child's life easier. There is also a very friendly and caring feeling for because the article says how their neighborhood is mostly immigrants and that they are a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants extended their hands to people well in need. I would say all the moods in this memoir is loving, caring, friendship, and equality. The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think thats what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid. One thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend. He also talked about how his parents showed him thier cooking skills and thier passion for cooking. The mood created by the author in the memoir is great @CAPS1. Narciso loved to cook. \"A love of cooking that is still with me today.\" Narciso loved his parents very much. \"I will always be grateful to my parents For their love and sacrifice.\" The Rodriguez family help people come into ther house hold. \"It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country\". This was the mood created by the author in the memoir. In this memoir, Narciso talks about how it was hard to be raised by immagrant parents in @LOCATION1, getting cruddy jobs for low pay, but his home is his home, where all of his memories are. In my opinion, his mood is happy, and joyful, based on how much he talks about his home. Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is a memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives and it is about Narciso Rodriguez's early life. The major mood in the memoir is honesty and truthfulness. This is because the author talks about that you don't want to hear or that makes you sad to hear. For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it: \"a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close – knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need\" (@NUM1). In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is honesty and truthfulness because the author tells us about things that might make us uncomfortable. The mood in this memoir I believe  is appreciation and caring towards others. @NUM1 home as well as neighborhood was a place of unity and caring for one another like a family. In the memoir it says that people were always coming in and out of the house for a place to stay or for a meal to eat and were always welcomed with open arms. \"Family\"  to him didn't mean you were related but were loved and cared for by other and with that mindset he had a huge family. His parent left behind their lives in Cuba where they were both scientists and had friends and family there for their son. They knew that the United States had better oppurtunitis for Narciso (in which he becomes a designer). He states several times how grateful he is of his parents for them to move to the @LOCATION3 for him as well as making his house feel like a home. The mood created by the author in the memoir is. First, the moon that I think is a warm and and saying there's no place like home feeling. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it states all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship as in home and and the people around us is like family and we come and unit as friends and families. Also Narciso Rodriguez says in paragraph @NUM2 \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. To finish my describtion of the mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez theres no place like to feel at home. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our Lives the overall mood of the author is greatfulness. Narciso begins the memoir by telling us how much @CAPS3 appreciates his culture and all that his parents do for him In paragraph @NUM1, \"... And unwittenly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking... (For which I am eternally greatful)\" @CAPS3 has an optemistic outlook on every aspect of his family and his culture. Most of it had to do with how @CAPS3 grew up and was born into a family who had just finished their hardships of getting int @LOCATION1. The mood of the memoir is appreciation. I think it's this mood because in the final paragraph the author says, \"... I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" @CAPS1 fact is, in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 talks about how he kept thanking his parents for everything he had. He states, \"I've often told them that what they did is a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" I guess he is just very grateful for his parents, his childhood, everything and everyone he has ever met, had or done in his life. If I were in his shoes, I'd be grateful, too. This opened my eyes and now, I, too, am grateful for everything and everyone I have in my life. The author shows many moods while writing this memoir, like gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. @ORGANIZATION1 is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart. Also he is grateful for how they always made him safe. In the last sentence Narciso says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside. The @CAPS1 created by the auther is that in paragraph @NUM1 it States that \"Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home. It was verry heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwitting pakd onto me their rich culinary Skills and a love a cooking that is still with me today.\" I think this relats to the @CAPS1 of the memoir because living in @LOCATION1 you could Still have a house and life stile like you were Still living back where you live, in this case in Cuba.\" The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and up lifting. The author discussed the positives in his life. He did not dwell on the negatives, did not say what he would like to change. The positive mood of the memoir made it entertaining to read.The author emphasized the fact that his parents moved to @LOCATION1 because it was best for their children. They would sacrafice having the jobs that they deserved. They immigrated to @LOCATION1 to give their children a better life. His parents cared about the future of their kids, and they were unselfish.The way in which the author honors his parents makes the story very enjoyable. The mood is positive and keeps the reader interested and involved. It was a very good story. The mood created in this story was happiness and greatfulness towards his parents. In the story he told the many sacrifices his parents made to give him a better life than the one they had. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" \"But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit of generosity.\" His parents came to the country knowing little engish and having to start their lives over just so that his life would be better. The mood created by the author in the memoir is emotional. The mood is emotional because his family left ther homeland for the freedom of ther children. They gave up everthing including family for the kids. The fact that they didn't know anybody or the town itself was amazing. Jobs were few, money was sarce. Even though hard times, after there over, it's the best times of all. Family can be in a place with no relatives, That is the mood created by the autheor in the memoir The author creates a special mood in this memoir. The mood the author gives is a very comfortable mood. He talks about his family and how they all ate together and always had relatives stoping by. It gives you a sense of togetherness. It gives you a sense of how the family interacted and became one with the neighborhood. So the author of this article really shows how just the whole town had a sense of togetherness with the family. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" I believe he goes from a calm mood to a proud mood. He starts off describing his life so far and family. How he used to live in a one-room apartment in Cuba and how his family lives in Newark, New Jersey along with other Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immagrints. Then he talks about the neighborhood and how together are great solidarity and friendships. Also, a honest and hard working community mostly immagrints. He also said, \"I will always be grateful to my for their love and sacrifice.\" (paragraph @NUM1) I think Narciso feel thankful and proud to be a Cuban and have such wonderful parents. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" (last sentence) Narciso Rodriguez could not describe his home any better, it was as if I was there with him. I can see he really remembers the sound, shites, and smells of his home. \"...situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culture. Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" That whole paragraph really gave me a good feeling, and I could tell the mood was always a happy one considering all the festivities. Therefore the mood is happy and warm, I would love to be there. There where many different moods that the author created in the memoir. The three most important moods where grateful, loving, and happy. The first mood the author showed for this story was being grateful. This family was very lucky to move from cuba to the @LOCATION1 and find a better home. They where also lucky that they where going to have a better life. The second most important mood was loving. This family showed alot of love for each other. An example that shows how loving they are is when it @CAPS1 they left their family, friends, and careers so their children could have a better life. The last mood was happyness. When reading this story you can really tell that this family was happy. It talks about how they will never forget the memories and how generous their parents where. In conclusion there where many different moods in this story. The three main moods where grateful, loving, and happy In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives a loving and caring mood to the readers. I think this because whe he describes certain things, like his parents, he would add a loving and caring feeling. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" That sentence indicates how much he Loved his parents for doing that. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" that indicates how apriciative he was. Also this memoir gives a grateful and thankful mood because it makes you think about the people and family members that had loved and sacrificed for you. That is why I think the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 gives off loving and caring mood to the readers. The mood created by the author is welcoming. \"In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey.\" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. \"In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship.\" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. \"Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.\" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely cuban music playing. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home There are many moods in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez. One of the moods are loving \"I learned here how to love.\" @CAPS1 mood is caring \"my parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people who were considered family. And @CAPS1 mood was happiness \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations\" That is the mood of this memoir. The author was so thankful, they explained how they thank there parrents for moving here. And how a house can become a  home and how important family and friends relationships are The mood Created by the author brought out a Cuban @CAPS1 of heritage and family. The mood set here is that family doesn't mean \"blood relatives\" it is People who need help and will have that Same felling for @CAPS2 if @CAPS2 needes that same help. The mood @CAPS3 how @CAPS2 have to go threw alot of times where it's hard and @CAPS2 will lament but @CAPS2 have to get through it and it will pay off. your culture is a part of the mood of the story. This @CAPS4's @CAPS5's came from cuba and had a one bedroom apartment raises a kid and still helped others. The apartment is turned into a cubain house hold of food and music and families. The mood elavtes and esksimtes as they spend more time more family better living space better job and most of all better under standing. The mood of the whole story really cenies around family and the true meaning of family. family is your love ones who care and help, love and respect @CAPS2, That's the mood of the story. The mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez's love. Love is the mood for many reasons. One reason is that Narciso's parents were very caring. \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family\" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents cared about everybody as if they were part of the family. Another reason the mood is love is because Narciso talks about how his parents were selfless. With courage they moved to @LOCATION1 without knowledge of the lanunguage or the culture.\" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" (paragraph @NUM2). @PERSON2's parents did everything out of pure love. Because of them @PERSON2 lived a life filled with happiness and love. The mood in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is happy and grateful. In ph. @NUM1, Narciso's parents gave up all they had to leave Cuba and come to @LOCATION1 where their children could have a better life. Narciso was so grateful to them that he couldn't express a thank you in words in ph. @NUM2. In ph. @NUM2, it also states that he is really grateful for his parent's love and sacrifice. The reason he is happy, I think is because he has a family that loves him. Even though they're from different cultures they came together and that wouldn't have happened if his parents hadn't immigrated. That is why I think the mood is happy and truely grateful. The mood in the memoir is basicly showing love, happiness, and friendship. The way that the mood shows love is in @CAPS1 @NUM1 and @NUM2. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 is says Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 it talks about how his parent welcome refugees to celebrate their arrival to @LOCATION1. Happiness was shown throughout the story. And friendship was shown as well The way that friendship was shown by his parents keeping their door open to whom who did not have a home. But let them stay in their home until their back on he or she is back on there feet, and considerd part of the family. This memoir creates a peacefull mood. It is telling us of his childhood. Narciso writes, \"In 1961 I was born into this simple house,\". As a child you have nothing but peace. He had many visitors. He writes \"my mother took in refug is welcoming them into the country\". He obviously had a nice enviornment with all those visitors. He is explaining his past. He loves his house and the enviornment it creates. He writes \"I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home,\". It just put your mind at ease. That is how this article creates a peace ful mood In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, though they were all struggling to get buy. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot. Narciso's parents had highly skilled well paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get whatever jobs they could find in @LOCATION2. They would always help someone in their family if necesary, and often did. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by. They did all this without loosing their culture (Cuban music and food). Their entire neighborhood, one big family, survived and thrived on little. Being a blood relative wasn't the only defenition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, @ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS3 is hard and happy.The first place in the story when the @CAPS3 creates a hard mood is when they say that racism is overt. \"Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 immigrants overt racism\". this show that the mood is hard because we know that at that time racism was occurring so that made it hard for them to fit in with everybody else.The last place in the story were the author creates a happy mood is when the neighborhood came together. \"In our neighborhood, despite custom elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship\". This displays a happy mood because is represents a whole bunch of diffrent people comming together to work together.As you can see @CAPS3 creates two different types of moods hard, and happy. @ORGANIZATION1 tells the story of his childhood and the feel good-times of his family\" in a small house in Newark. Rodriguez shares a unique happy feeling with this excerpt; the feeling of great memories that have been strengthened with each day. The phrases he uses to help describe the house like \"passionate Cuban music filled the air\" and \"the congregation of family\" established this vibrant and happy feeling of the welcoming household he grew up in. The excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, with \"extended family\" also, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen. As the author goes on to tell how grateful he is for his parents and wonderful, warm childhood, it provides a serene and a down-to-earth honesty from the author. The excerpt recreates a feel good time of a carefree life and worryless days that provide a wonderful atmosphere for the reader.\" The mood the author creates is the sadness of living one country where freinds and family lived. To happiness of the times they've shared in the United States. As the memoir states the center of the home was the kitchen where here parents split cooking duties and where passionate Cuban music filled the air the the kitchen's aroma. In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family even if it meant leaving their country, freinds, and family behind. The author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister. These are the moods the author creates throughout the memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir is they had no problem finding a house. for example the author states \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful).\" This means that they are great cooks and have skills for cooking. \"Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us.\" Even though they first came to the @CAPS1. S they had no problem finding a home. \"It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays.\" This is saying his mom keeps the traditions with all the celebrations for new comers to the @LOCATION1 In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way. The author in the memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our lives creates the mood of gratitude and admiration towards his parents.One example of how the author shows gratitude is by mentioning how thankful he is toward his parents. Specific textual evidence that proves this is \"... unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" This quotation creates the mood of appreciation by simply stating \"eternally grateful\". Furthermore, another textual evidence which proves my thesis is \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 the authors use and repititon of the word \"grateful\", or \"thankful\" creates a mood.Another example of how the author creates a mood is by showing admiration for his parents. According to the text he says \"I've often told my admiration for their strength and perseverance.\" This quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them. The author also creates the mood of admiration when he says \"... what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done.\" @CAPS2 this quotation the author recognizes that his parents faced many hardships, and praises them by showing his admiration. The mood in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by @PERSON1 is very cozy and welcomeing. Inside the @PERSON1 home the @CAPS1 describes a cozy and friendly atmospher. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed bot, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\". This quote shows how cozy or \"warm\" their home is. In the memoir he also explains how welcome people are and that everyone in the Apartment building was friends or even family! \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sence that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" This quote means that in his welcomeing home friends were also concidered his family. Narciso Rodriguez had a wonderful @CAPS2 to grow up in. In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a \"simple house\" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of \"twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria\" or about \"Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day).\" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel \"at home\", which is the topic of the memoir. In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story. The author creates many different moods throughout the memoir. In the beginning, the author talks about his traditional Cuban home, in which he feels extremely comfortable and safe. Here, he creates a mood of warmth, and a very family oriented upbringing, all positively. Around paragraph @NUM1, the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family. For example, (paragraph @NUM1, final sentence) \"The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them. (his parents) to endure these hard times.\" This gives a mood of pride and great triumph. That is the mood that @PERSON1 gives in the memoir from \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives.\" The mood created by the author in the memoir is a verry happy tone. The reasons that its a happy tone is because @CAPS1 tells about her Childhood hapily by talking about the unity of his invirorment and the happiiness, cuban food, and Cuban music that filled his home and that still fills his home today because he injoyes it so much. The mood in the memoir, which the author is trying to show you is pretty much the happiness and gratefullness that Narciso Rodriguez has to be cuban. Narciso is bringing the mood of happiness in this memoir learning all about his Cuban background and how much he is greatful for his mom and dad. The author is trying to show you appriciation and gratefulness. This whole memoir is trying to show readers how great it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things. This memoir is representing good moods and happiness. To always be grateful for what you have in you life, exspecially your family, friends, & your life. The mood in this memoir is very happy and gratefull In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives there is a mood of happyness created. There are several examples from the article that show happyness. The first example is \"they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life\". Narciso's parents left everything they had just to give their son a better life. This made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him. The second example is \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This shows he is very aware all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much. The third and final example is \"It was here I learded the true definition of family.\" Where he moved to his parents, siblings, and neighbors became his \"family\" and although he didn't know all of his \"real\" family he was happy with the one he had. Those three examples show the mood of the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\". Based on the memoir \"Narciso @CAPS1\" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a very powerful and posative mood. One strong example of this is how he expresses his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like \"always be greatful for my parents\",  \"admiration for their strength\", \"perseverance\", and \"generosity.\" The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set. Narciso Rodriguez expresses a very positive and powerful mood about his family and his culture throughout the excerpt. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a ceartain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the moood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood realitives. It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family. They always came over and had dinner babysat him and every thing that is why it is love. As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created. This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them. The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, \"Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative.\" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home. A happy, grateful, and proud mood is expressed by the author in this memoir. The author, Narciso, expressed a grateful and happy mood by describing things his parents did for him that he was grateful for, as well as happy to have. \"... a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The author also expressed his pride in the story, by stating and describingwhat his parent's did that he was proud of. \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) \"they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) These were the moods the author expressed in the memoir. The mood created by the author was very happy. The author was grateful to his parents. For example in paragraph @NUM1: \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The author thanks his parents repeatedly for their strength. For example in paragraph @NUM1: \"I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" @CAPS1 will never forget his home. For example from paragraph @NUM3: \"I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home.\" The mood was very happy. The author was grateful, thankful, and never forgot his home. The mood created in the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\", is a mixture of happiness, relaxation, and gratefulness, even thought the memoir sometimes states how @PERSON1' parents had to give up their jobs in Cuba, and how overt racism was normal and segregation prevailed in the United States at the time, giving the mood as sadness, the article mainly consists Of happy memories. An example of this can be found throughout the story, especially in the ending paragraph when Narciso Rodriguez sums up the memoir and expresses how grateful he was toward his parents and the childhood he had. Also in the third and fourth paragraphs when he talks about his neighbors and how everybody got along with eachother, and how they frequently had meals together, I find the mood to be relaxing in paragraph three and four also, but mainly in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about his kitchen and the smells, aromas, and music that used to dance through the air. The over all mood of the memoir could be considered gratefullness. I could be considered gratefulness because Narciso Rodriguez always states how grateful he is for his parents and child hood. The mood in the story is very homely and happiness. The author clearly loved their childhood and was filled by great experiences and a loving background. The author was very greatful for the parents for what they have done. For moving to @LOCATION1, making sacrifices, wanting a better life for them. Also how their home was a great enviroment. always open, cozy, and loving. The mood of the cooking, family coming together, and of the cheerful music is just great. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It symbolizes togetherness and coming together as a family. In this passage evry one is caring and open to anyone living with them. The child in this story talks abou how greatful they are for there parints. Their happy because their all a family living together as one. Evry one is exsepting of one and another. Over all I think the mood is happy. The mood created by the auther in the memoir is happyness because in the memoir it describes how many memories are in his house, and it is also happyness because he mentioned his family and friends, and how peacful it is Also because he describes that there was a @CAPS1 cuban music that filled the air. He also described were his house is and he loves cooking, and he describes it as a rich culenary cooking that he loves so much. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, uses detailed descriptions of her childhood to create a warm, gentle, and grateful mood in the passage The memoir begins with Rodriguez explaining her Cuban heritage and how big of a role that played in her life This creates an idea of pride and love for who you are. Narcisco goes on to say how her parents were ways welcoming and inviting and how they sacrificied basically their whole life so they could make a better life for their children. In the final paragraphs the author expresses pure graditutity for everything her parents have given up and done. In one line Rodriguez praises parents when she thanks them again saying, \"there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" All of these details contribute to the overall mood of the memoir. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by @PERSON1 he writes mainly about how grateful he is for everything he grew up with and is truly the mood created by the author. Narciso is grateful for his cuban culture and how it was incorperated into his life growing up even though he was in New Jersey. He is also grateful for his parents and the sacrafices they made for him in order to grow up in @LOCATION2. His parents also taught him to be kind to everyone, and treat everyone like family. He is grateful for that. There are Many ways I can explain the @CAPS1 created by the author in the @CAPS2.One way I can explain the @CAPS1 created by the author in the @CAPS2 is That he is so greatfull for having Parents that care about him and want him to get a good edication.The second way is that @CAPS1 is always happy at his home, he always has some cuban spirit in his house. his perents cook cuban food and have There Family together.The third way is that he Loved his house how his perents Made it so confortible and his perents made so many of his birthdays there, he had a great time at that house \"I will never forget how my parents turned his simple house into a home\"This are some of the ways I explained the @CAPS1 created In this memoir the mood sounds like a happy one. An example of how you might know this is in paragraph @NUM1 when it discribed what he loved doing with his parents and family. Also throughout the whole memoir you can feel the happiness when he talks about eating dinner with all his family members and friends. One more detail about the mood is that he sounds very grateful for what his parents did and the hard choice they had to make about moving to @LOCATION1. There are some details of why I think the mood of this memoir is happiness The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy setting. In the memoir, the setting is a happy setting, in a sense of living because in the passage, there are parenthesis that explain how much the narrator appreciAtes his family and his heratige. In the passage in paragraph @NUM1, it explains how the families are close and help those in need, even wheN things arent going so soomthly for them. Also there are certain words in the passage that would help with the mood, words such as selflessly, solidary, love, friendship, and sacrifice. In my opinion, this words help bring the mood to a happy, calming feeling to the passage. The \"happy\" mood is created by the authoR in this memoiR. The mood the author used in the memoir is showing how proud their family is. Narciso shows how greatful and proud she is that her parents would change cultures, language, and also find a new job so she could be born in @LOCATION1. The author also shows how close their family is. They have an extended family because they live with their grandparents. Narciso is very proud to live in the family she is, and grateful that her parents did all of that for her. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is happiness. The author is gratefull that his parents were selfless and gave him a home in Newark, New Jersey. He is gratefull because his parents helped out other people move into @LOCATION2 and weren't selfish, the left stranger live in their home until they were ready to move on. In the last sentenee it says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. That is the mood of Narciso Rodriguez as he was growing up. In this memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez it shows the story of how a young boys home and parents have changed his life forever. Originally from @LOCATION2's parents immigrated to the United States in 1956. They started off in a small apartment then later getting the money to move into a \"simple house.\" \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relation.\" @CAPS1 some of the most loving families are not related.     The mood in this memoir is inspiring to the narrator. This allows the reader to feel such love and happiness which is being expressed. \"They came selflessly as many immigrants do to give their children a better life.\" The narrator is explaining what courage it took for his parents to make such an adjustment for the sake of his own happiness.     Overall the memoir \"@PERSON1\" is a story full of love and should be told for generations to come. The main lesson here is don't take your family for granted, the narrator is forever grateful that his parents \"turned this simple house into a home. The mood in the memoir was created in a couple of different ways by the author. One of the moods that was created in the memoir was happiness. Back in his past, his parents shared all of their Cuban family recipes, they had a lot of family and friend celebrations with the rest of the neighbor hood, sharing friendship and helping others in need @CAPS1 as long as you can sea, the family and the neighbors all came together as one big family to be happy, to make a happy community, and that made the memoir happy. Another mood that was created by the author was sadness. At the end of the memoir, the author went back to the present, talking about the past times. At the end, he thanks his parents for everything. He talks about how he came around to learned the definition of family and how he learned to love. Because of this, the old memories seem to get further away, and the mood changes to sadness. The memories are growing old, but he will always remember his \"family\"and his name. The author did a great job at creating those two moods and putting them into his memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir was simply love. for his family and the people @CAPS1 him. Especially his parents who came to @LOCATION1 from cuba. And At first they struggled but they knew that there was hope and happiness in the near future. Love for his culture that came from cuba with the music and food. And most of all the place he had called home Not the space, but everything and everyone @CAPS1 him. The mood that Narciso Rodriguez created was a very happy and uplifting mood. It makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that. You wish and hope that you could have a life like that where everyone will do anything for you and everyone is so close and they have dinner every night together. He makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live. That even though you left your family, friends, jobs everything is okay because you are with each other. You are with your family but they are not your blood family. They are having so much fun with people you just met because they are so excited that they made it to @LOCATION1 and they are just having fun with their culture and tradition. The whole neighborhood is one big family they all call the older people who are living in their basement their grandparents when their real grandparents are in Cuba. It just makes you think about your family and all they do for you. The mood created by the author in the memoir is @CAPS1. In @CAPS2 @NUM1, he says how his parents left everything they loved to give the author a better life in @LOCATION1. In @CAPS2 @NUM2, the author says, \"I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice.\" In @CAPS2 @NUM3, the author says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM1, the author talks about how his parents @CAPS3 nothing about the country when they came and how the struggled financially when they came. Also in @CAPS2 @NUM2, the author talks about how he could not thank his parents enough for all they have done for him. The mood created by the author is one of loving mood. The author is very grateful for all that his parents did for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, \"...and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" @CAPS1 loved how his parents loved him back too. They came to @LOCATION1 for him to have a better life. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" @CAPS1 loves his parents for the sacrifice they made for him. The author wrote, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The author has created a loving mood in his memoir. The mood of the author Narciso Rodriguez was he was always proud of his culture and mom and dad. For example in paragraph two it talks about @CAPS1 where he lived and how he said that he \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)\". \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). In the story @PERSON2 always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile. And he was positive and honest. And he even talked about his community \"It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.\" And Narciso also said \"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.\" The mood conveyed in the memoir is love. The author talks about how thankful he is for his parents love and sacrifice. In other words, he loves his parents because of the love they showed him. Also, the author discusses the unity and love between his family and neighbors. Although they weren't blood related, they formed family-like relationships. Furthermore, the author states, \"a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.\" Just the mere smell of his mother's cooking brought love to the entire room. To conclude, the author used many examples to explain to readers the love that was shared in his home. In the @ORGANIZATION1. Narciso Rodriguez tells about his life at home when he was a child. The mood of this story is happy because he tells how selflessness his parents were and how his family always looked out for one another even though they werent the richest family they still stuck together. In paragraph @NUM1 it says how the teachings have stuck with him his whole life and how import family and his friends were to him which creates a warm setting. In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez he created a mood of happiness and joyfulness. Narciso Rodriguez creates this mood by showing the generosity his parents have towards their son, family and friends. I also feel another mood that Narciso expresses is love.iI say this because his parents sacrifice everything they had because they wanted a better Life for their son. \"The faith that this struggle with lead them and their children to better times dove them to endure these hard times\". In this quote is love. Narciso's parent's new that for him to have a better life they would need to sacrifice thirs. That is why i feel love is a mood protrayed in the memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir was in a very thankful mood. The author shows how proud @CAPS1 was of his parents and how thankful @CAPS1 is. @CAPS1 also like His new enviroment, and his surprised how all the cultures fit together with No problem. @CAPS1 also explains how grateful @CAPS1 was to His parents for their love and sacrifice. In conclusion @CAPS1 was very proud and thankful to his parents. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez The auther makes the mood seem fermiluar and loving. He created a mood very uplifting and loving as if to say your childhood and family is the heart of your home.                                           In paragraph two the author states that he had lived in a home were celibrations, that formed a backdrop to life in his warm home. What the auther means is, family and friends made the home feel enviting and comterable. The author also explans restating from paragraph four \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" This scentence explains that even if there friends and family had no were to go, they were always welcome in their home.    This memoir creats a very loving mood. In the last paragraph the author explains that home is were he learned the real definition of family and love. There are Three Things That discribe The @CAPS1 in This memior. one of Them is The authors love for his Cuban heritage. \"@CAPS2 cuban music [which I love to this day] filled the air, Mixing The aroma of the kitchen. Another way The author discribes The @CAPS1 is The houses his parents owned. \"In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in The @CAPS4 bound @CAPS5 of Newark, New Jersey\". The last thing That discribes The @CAPS1 is The love and sacrifice That They gave there son. \"It was in This simple house That My Parents Welcomed other refugees To celebrate @CAPS7 arrival To This country and where I Celebrated My first birthdays. \"Cuban food and music were every were.\"                                                                                                                                             This is how the author discribes The @CAPS1 in This @CAPS9. The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy apreshiates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house to a home. So thats the mood of the memoir. In the memoir, the author created a mood. The mood was a very good one that shows everyone that reads it, that the human race can be genuinely kind and helpful. No matter what race you are or where you come from, you don't have to be blood related to be \"family\" and we can all extend a hand to the people that need the most help. The author's parents gave him great love and sacrificed alot for him; @CAPS1 is very thankful to them for that. @CAPS1 tells them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then @CAPS1 could've ever done and @CAPS1 has great admiration for their strength and perseverance. Being an immagrant you have to be unselfish because most parents do it to give their children a better life. The author learned the real definition of \"family\" and for that, @CAPS1 said @CAPS1'll never forget that house or the many things about how to love. In the memoir, it creates a peaceful mood. The mood the author created in the memoir loving and happiness. The mood was happiness and loving toward his two parents. Quote: \"I will alway be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice.\" The mood show that the author had a great childhood and loved his neighborhood very much. Quote: \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many thing I learned there about how to love.\" The mood the author created also showed that he didn't care if they didn't have a lot of money, he loved it where he lived and all the people that live in it, even if they weren't a blood relative. Quote: \"Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blond relative.\" To wrap it all up, the mood the author created in the memoir was about love and happiness. The author in the memoir tried to create a specific mood. This mood is appreciation. He is saying all the things he is thankful for. \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly...\" In this quote he is thanking and appreciating all the work his parents went through to give him a good life. He is also admiring the things they went through such as leaving behind their families, and careers in the country they loved. He is greatful for the house he lived in and he looks back at the memories of them cooking in the kitchen again, with the smells of Cuban foods, and sounds of Cuban music. He expresses all of this in the last few lines of the memoir that state: \"And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" In conclusion, the author's memoir is all about his appreciation of the good things that came to him in his childhood, and the memories he will never forget In the excerpt \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives the author leaves a friendly, compassionate, and graceful mood. This excerpt leaves a friendly mood because of how much friendlyness is given by Narciso Rodriguez neighborhood at his younge age' In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and frienship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Also this excerpt leaves a compassionate mood because of how much compassion Narciso's parents showed to familys of friends who need a push or help to stand on their feet once again. \"countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone stying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family...\" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) Rodriguez leaes a grateful mood when he continues to thank his parents for their love. \"I will always be greater to my parents for their love and sacrifize... Admiration for their strength and perseverance.. and these teachings have been the basic of my life. Rodriguez uses these wonderful moods to describe his wonderful parents. The mood created by the author in the memoir is one that is used in lots of memoirs because they are like thing's: someone will never forget like the author said \"my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally gratefull). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. That's all stuff that he will never forget. The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family can live a better life. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't have to neccisarily blood related and can be someone you love and will help you. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood in \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is very warm and calm. There can be a lot of drama in a family, but @PERSON1 his backround and how much he loves his family and the people in his neighborhood. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" In the first paragraph Narciso @PERSON1 how he tackes in his culture. I says, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" Narciso @PERSON1 love and gratefulness in this excerpt, \"Narciso Rodriguez\". The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was grateful in the beginning of his memoir. Evidence from the text that supported this is paragraph @NUM1 it stated \"(and for which I am eternally grateful.)\"The second mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was thankful. He was thankful because his parants were immigrants and came to the country without knowing any language or the cultureThe last mood created by the author in the memoir was that he felt loved. He felted loved because his parents sacrifice for him. They welcomed many things in Narciso life. those are three moods that were created by the author in the memoir The mood in the @ORGANIZATION1 is displayed as happieness and appreciation. Narciso understands how much his parents had given up for him by moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\". by this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happieness comes from the appreciation because you cant appreciat something and it doesn't make you make a little bit happier. his happieness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying \"I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice\". The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, is a upbeat & happy mood. I know this because he states that he is very grateful for his parents to pass down the cooking recipes and skills, and the Cuban music that they would listen to.This is the mood @PERSON1 creates in the memoir. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the aurthor displays a mood. The mood is very calm and grateful as he explains how he feels to have his cuban culture and lifestyle. Explaining how his family loves cooking and playing music. The author just explains how he lived when he was with his parents. Then the author gets more detailed talking about who lived with him like his landlord and his daughter; his two granparents and others. The author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez,\" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a specific mood created. The mood is proud, because the author goes on about how amazing their parents are & how inviting the house was. In the memoir it says, \"Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" The author talks about how his/her home was full of Cuban culture and how great Cuban food is. The author also says, \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" The author is grateful and proud because her parents welcomed with open arms people of all types. The author was also proud that he/she was so close with neighbors that they were like relatives. This is why the mood created in the memoir is proud. The mood of the story is happy. Everyone spend time with their family, having fun together, celebrating together would give you a happy feeling of what a family is. It's like how the family in the story moved to the United States, they first doesn't know anyone, they haver no friends. They are living in an apartment that has one room, but years later, they moved to a @NUM1-room apartment. There live a family with a borned baby above them. the baby is the job for the main character (baby sitter) and also the main character's first friend. To the main character, friendships and home is very important to him. If there's no friendships and home, there will be no love. These taught the main character how to love and how to care about someone. else. The main character said friendship and home is the basis in his life, he understand without letting his parents teach him. When you have friendship, home, and love, everything will be perfect for you. All you need is a support from your family. You will be always happy and feel very lucky that you have all of these things. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is a nonstalgic mood is created from his memories. The mood is created by his parents and where he lives. One way the mood is nonstalgic is he's grateful towards his parents. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done\" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). By being grateful towards his parents, he is helping the nonstalgic mood grow. Also, where he live helps the mood. \"And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home those\" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Since his parents turned his house, to a home he will never forget what they did for him, making this memoir more nonstalgic. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a nonstalgic mood from the memories of his past. There are few moods created. They are comfort, Love and sacrifice. Comfort because of the way @PERSON1 described his home, parents, and neigborhood families. Love because his parents loved him and each other very much, and they cared about what they did and their family. Sacrifice because his parents sacrificed their comforting home to move to @LOCATION1 for their son. That was difficult for them, but @ORGANIZATION1 appreciated that. He loves his parents what they did for him. There Were many moods set by the @CAPS1 in the memoir. one of the moods was happiness. Narciso had a very happy family. They had many friends and Were thankful. Another mood the @CAPS1 set Was being proud. He was so proud to have parents who cared so much and had such selflessness. A third mood in the memoir is love. Narciso and his family Were loved by many and they also loved many back. His parents arms and doors Were open at all times for anybody needed to get back on their feet. Narciso was grateful to have such a great family (including extended). Throughout this memoir there was moods of caring, loving, grateful, & happiness. Those Were the moods the @CAPS1 set into this memoir. I think the mood of the story is being gratefull. I think this because in the story it says Narciso thank his parents for their love and sacrifice.Also because in the story, Narciso says that his parents turned a simple house into a home. Which means they were kind and selfless.And he says that \"the warmth of the kitchen of his humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. In this memoir, the mood is very pleasant and makes you think of childhood memories. The reason is because he talks about how his parents guided him to be a strong-willed man, and he couldn't have done it unless he had the conditions he did then. He seems to think that if he didnt have the parents and oppurtunities he did then, his life would have been much different. So, the mood in this poem makes you feel like home is where the heart is. The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in his memoirs is very proud of his parents and happy. \"... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not.\" The author is happy, remembering memories, which are not unhappy or unpleasant. It's not romantic, lonely, or sad, it's happy, fun-filled, friendly, and fulfilled. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" Narciso is very appreciative of his parents, moving so @CAPS1 could have a better life and education than them. @CAPS1 expresses his gratitude toward them a lot. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 writes about how @CAPS1 told them what they did was a more courageous thing than @CAPS1 ever could have done, and his admiration for their perseverance and strength. @CAPS1 really does love and appreciate his parents and everything they did for him, that being a main theme of the memoir. The mood @CAPS2 and created by Narciso Rodriguez is proud and admiring of his parents, and very happy. In the story \"@PERSON1\", the mood created by the author is loving and peaceful. For example, Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing the aroma of the kitchen. This shows that the home is peaceful. Another example is, \"My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we consider family. This shows her family is kind and loving. lastly, I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. They shows she loves her parents very much and always will. In conclusion, that is the mood wich is loving and peaceful created by the author. The mood created by the @CAPS1 in this memoir is mostly grateful through the memoir. It's grateful well because the @CAPS1 talks about how thankful he is that he has such loving Parents who risked sacrifised their Jobs, and @CAPS2 everything they had back in Cuba to go to the united states where they did not know the language, had no money, and at the moment no shelter. I know it is grateful because the @CAPS1 clearly says \"I will always be grateful to my Parents For their love and Sacrifice.\" this pin-points the mood as well as throughout the excerpt the @CAPS1 speaks about his gratefulness to his Parents. In conclusion the mood to wards the article I think happens to be grateful. The mood by the outhor in the memoir is it about family culture and how I'd be in a house with your family friends ond how it's important and in the story it saing that Narciso Rodriguez parents move and how he is living and it saing how these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship And Narciso Rodriguez parents olwoys kept their door open to the people that they considered as family that they would do the same us them. And Narciso Rodriguez always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice they have for him and he said that he never is going to forget that house that he was live in or its gracious neighborhood that was so greateful for him and the things that he learned with his neighborhood how to love And he said he will never forget how his parents turned his simple house into a home. And thats how it's in Narciso Rodriguez house with his neighborhood that he like to be with This memoir definatley has a strong and apperent mood, and that mood stands out to me as Narciso being grateful, he is obiously very thankfull to his parents and family. I know this because the memoir says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" This quote really shows that @PERSON1 is thankfull for his parent's love for him.This mood comes out in the memoir when @PERSON2 says \"But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and @CAPS1 are.\" This quote shows how he is thankfull for his Family, but also how his Family shaped him as a person.In all, There are many emotions in this story, but the one that @CAPS2 out to me the most was him being gratefull. The author created a mood of immense gratefulness. The author knows that not every family (Cuban or possibly @CAPS1) can all get together and be truly happy and grateful for what they have. Not every family can work well with everyone else. Not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. This is a feeling of gratefulness because of the parents. The authors consistantly praises them on their courageous acts, and even going against the law to help those in need. The parens brought such happiness by welcoming those who are different and sharing happiness with them. The author had an incredible experience and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful parents that she had. The mood created by the author of the memoir is thankfulness. The mood is thankfullness because through the whole memoir the author is looking back on his life and is explaining how thankfull @CAPS1 is. In the memoir the author says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" @CAPS1 also expressed the importance of family and friends. @CAPS1 states that by stateing \"it was here where I learned the real definition of family.\" The mood created by the author is gratefulness.

Meaning that had to find all new jobs.The author explained her greatfulness by telling her parents that what they did was much more courageous than she could ever do. The author also said that there was no way to express her gratitude for the generosity impressed upon her at such an early age. A) The mood that was created in this memoir was a basic mood. It wasn't a happy or sad in was a flat mood, because Its talking about how their in debt needed to move the kid lost all of his friends. The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education. so that is why its a basic or flat mood. I also belive its a basic mood because it says that \"kids have to do a lot of the work\" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end It gets to a happy mood because it say \"my parents will always be there for me.\" In the memoir @PERSON1 written by @PERSON1 the mood is happiness. First, Rodriguez writes, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)\" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents have a great skill and love for cooking, now Narciso has a great love and skill for cooking as well. Both of which he is still happy to have today. Finally, @PERSON1 writes, \"And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into home\" (paragraph @NUM2) Narciso learned about love in the house. his parents had a @NUM3 room house, but there were able to turn it into home. The size of the house does not matter, it matters who you are there with. in conclusion Narciso is greatful and happy for everything his parents have done for him.  @PERSON1 wrote this memoir in a happy, warm, senseful way. He was able to describe in great detail what went on in his house during his childhood and how caring and loving his parents were. Not just to him but to almost anybody. Anyone that was considered family was allowed in and he was also grateful to be Cuban and for the foods he was able to eat and the beautiful aromas in his Cuban kitchen. His description of this home is very soothing to me because it just has a happy background and his talk so highly of. It is a tempting place to attend life in this make the best of\" little Cuban home.\" The mood the author gave in the @CAPS1. was a very happy, thoughful, respectful, thankful, moved when he explained his reason and his thoughts, him expressing his family life was very nice he said the best things his parents did for him was to leave there family in cuba and start a new life in @LOCATION1 for new life and, future, also he expressed that he always thanked his parents for what they have done for him. but he knew that wasn't the best way it was just that he had to prove he was thankful. The life @PERSON1 lived as a child was a paradise in his eyes. He learned what a family really was, people who cares for eachother no matter what. And in his eyes, his whole community was one big family. His parents were kind, giving and generous to everyone. Despite the different customs elsewhere, all of these cultures were united as one family. They would lend a hand for anyone who needed it, because they know that they'd do the same for them. Throughout his life, he'd never forget his wonderful childhood and all the things he was taught, @CAPS1 and Generosity. In this memoir,\" @PERSON1, he is feeling loving when he wrote this. One @CAPS1 is when he says, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give there children a better life...\" is showing an @CAPS1 of love. Also, when he says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Last @CAPS1 is when he said, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. In this memoir, you can tell @PERSON1 really cares about his family, especially his loving parents. In the memoir, \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,\" the author, Narciso Rodriguez created a mood throughout the memoir of his home and Family. Narciso talks about how lucky he was to have had such a wonderful home where he belonged and a family that was always there for him. Narciso put it best in the last few lines of his memoir that say \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\"A big mood in the memoir was a feeling of warmth and happiness, an enviroment where everyone was family, a strong sense of community, togetherness and belonging, that love, care, family and friendship is always there, and that this was home, always and forever. \"In our neighborhood,... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need... My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us.\"@CAPS1 mood in the memoir was a feeling of strong love and gratefulness Narciso felt for his parents. They were strong, courageous, selfless and brave, and they gave up so much to give Narciso a better life.\" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" The author created a mood of his home and family in the memoir, \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives.\" The author has many moods in the memoir. One of his moods is that he is happy. \"A cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and Love\". This quote shows that he is happy. Another mood is that he is grateful. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This proves that he is grateful. These are the authors mood in the memoir. The overall mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez, in the memoir is very warm, loving, and shows great unity at his old home and family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso talks about the great selflessness and courage that his parents had when they immigrated to @LOCATION2. Narciso talks about how grateful he is to them, for leaving their homeland so that he could have a better life. During the @NUM2 and @NUM3 paragraphs of the memoir, Narciso describes the warms and generosity of his family. He also showed how family doesn't necessarily mean a blood relative. His family came from Cuba, but there were also other cultures in their neighborhood such as @CAPS1, and also Spanish immigrants as well This loving and extremely rich cultural background that he had lived in as a child showed great unity between different types of people. Narciso's family's door was always open to anyone in need. Narciso Rodriguez's definition of family, shows that his background was full of sharing, joy, and love all squeezed into his small apartment in New Jersey. In today's aspects, @PERSON1 wouldn't be considered wealthy, but underneath material, he is more wealthy than most people will ever be. For example, \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a relative.\" Family is very valuable, and a great wealth to Narciso, and throughout the memoir he keeps bringing the feelings of family. It's seem like that emotion was give that held everything together and would make it all ok! He also experiences great gratitude towards his parents and his neighbors; \"But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit and generosity impressed on me at a such an early age and be demonstration or how important family and friends are.\" I think the overall mood of this memoir is very warm, and optemistic about life. They make the best of their situation, and that really made an impression on Narciso. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\"  The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is immense gratitude, happiness, and admiration. Rodriguez describes his home @CAPS1 writes, \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\" (@NUM1). Rodriguez expresses happiness reminiscing about his home that was \"warm.\" @CAPS2, the mood shows admiration towards his parents. @CAPS1 writes, \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, withot any knowledge of the language or the culture\" (@NUM2). Rodriguez admires his parents for coming to @LOCATION1, ready to work hard, despite the problem of knowing nothing about the country. Lastly, the mood can be described as thankfulness, or gratitude. Rodriguez writes, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" (@NUM3). The house was more than just the physical part; his parents filled it with love and compassion, and Narciso Rodriguez is extremely greatful The overall mood of the passage is greatfulness and happiness In the memoir from \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\" the creates a good mood of accomplishment. The mood first develops in the first paragraph, when Narciso writes of his parents immigrating from Cuba and being able to move up from a one room to a three room apartment. The second appearance of this mood is when the author writes of how their community came together and helped eachother through the segregation and racism of the time period. The third and last demonstration of the mood is how the parents took what they could get and made their house, into a home. Accomplishment, is the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir from \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\". The mood of this memoir was appreciative. The author reflects upon his experiences at home in a positive manner which expresses the fact that he is thankful for what he had. \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful) (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows Narciso's appreciation for the culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also provide a grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word \"grateful\" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says \"But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age\" There is so much passion in this phrase. \"There is no way to express my gratitude\" shows that he's just so thankful there is not way to even express it. The author really shows the reader that he is appreicative of his family. The mood that Narciso Rodriguez protrayed very strongly in \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is gratitude. In the memo I @CAPS1 mentions how thankful @CAPS1 truly is to his parents for giving him a life of family, and happiness, love etc. For example @CAPS1 thanks them for their \"rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful).\" Narciso is grateful in a way @CAPS1 could never be able to show them his gratitude. \"... I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity...\" Narciso \"will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 is greatful for what they did for a better life, for showing him happiness, family, love and sacrifice. Overall the main mood of this memoir is gratitude. The mood created by the author in the memoir Come in different ways. The first mood giving is greatful, in the \"Skills and the love of cooking that is still with me today\" @CAPS1 mood of greatful is \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" The mood of Admiration, \"I often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance. In this memoir there was a lot of moods, the ones the stood out from the author was his greatfulness and admiration. The mood created by the author in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is gratefulness.

The author explains how he has been telling his parents of how much more courageous their plan was then his would have ever been. The author also says how he admired how much strength and perseverance his parents had and how he has thanked them repeatedly. His parent taught him two lessons with out telling him, but with their lives, \"and these teachings have been the basis of my life\", the author states. Finally in the last paragraph the very last sentence says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" which ultimately shows how grateful Narciso Rodriguez truly is. the mood in the memoir can be exaessed in many different ways. The memoir is mostly eprssed with gratitude from Narciso to his parents. He describes in good detail all the sacrifices his parents made for him. Leaving behind all their friends and family, the hot climate, and their cultures back in Cuba. Another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness. Narciso's parents were kind to everyone. They turned their house into a hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go. They had open dinner where friends and family members came. Even when they struggled financially they still let everyone in. Narciso's parents made the biggest sacrifice for him. What they did for him created the beautiful moods described in the memor. In this selectian family is being defined, and Narciso Rodriguez gives it a whole new definition. Narciso Rodriguez is now a recognized clothing designer, but as a child she also had a great life ful of laughter and love. She grew up in a two family home within Newark, New Jersey. I can now smell, hear, and picture  the inside of where Narciso grew up. \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today, and for which I am eternally gratefull.\" This sentence gives me an image of that happy family and puts me in a good mood, While it reminds me of my our family and the memories that we share among our kitchen. Passionate Cuban music, which I adore to this day, filled the air mixing with the aromas in the kitchen. This sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime.

It even mentions in the passage that he's \"grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" It uses words such as \"warm\", which here means friendly, \"aroma\", \"rich\", and \"solidarity\". All these words, and many other words close in meaning, set this mood. In the @NUM1 paragraph it mentions all the sacrifice that his parents took to get their family to @LOCATION1.

Sometimes the mood is sad, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.

Like When he says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Narciso starts off the memoir by talking about the hardships of his parents and than goes into how well of a home they made for him. He than talks about all of the good times that they have, and than, he thanks them one more time. The mood created for me in this memoin is a grateful, happy, and mostly thankful mood. I believe the mood is grateful because it is mentioned by the narrator many times like during the third paragraph where he mention how grateful he is to have parents who made good meals and taught him how to cook. Also he said he was grateful for being introduced to cuban music. I think this memoir also has a happy mood because although the hardships are mentioned it wasn't about how they struggled but how the concoured the hardships they faced when immigrating to @LOCATION1. Another way this memoir is happy is because he talks about how happy everyone is and how family makes a house turn into a home it just touches your heart and gives you a sence of happiness. I think this memoir is mostly thankful because this whole memoir to me feels like a thank you letter to the narator's parents. That is how the mood created in the memoir to me was grateful, happy, and mostly thankful.

I believe the author is happy because he/she is very grateful for the love of cooking his/her parents passed down to him/her. \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" I believe he's/she is delightful just the way he/she wrote the memoir. The words she/he used, the way he/she wrote them just sounds delightful to be who he/she is. The author sounds unique to me because he/she is just happy that he/she is Cuban and is happy with what he/she has. This is what I think the authors mood is in the memoir. The mood the author created was a peaceful mood. She was bringing up good memories of her past life in her home. She was saying how she was eternally greatful for everything her parents gave her and taught her. Her parents tought her much about her heritage when she was young and kind, she lived in a very diverse area growing up there were Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. There were times of racism and violence. The overall mood she created in this memoir was sad, happy and peaceful. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, there are many moods. There are happy, grateful, stressed, calm, relaxed and harsh moods. Some are happy moods because they have each other. There are grateful mood because of all that Narciso's parents did for him. There are stressed moods because his parents don't get the jobs they deserve. There are calm moods to show the contentness he had in his home. There are relaxed moods to explain the feelings he had for his life and there was even harsh moods to show the tough times they went through and such. Even though some moods are good and some are bad. This story shows the love they have for each other and that even though they might go through some hard times. They can stick through it together. Narciso Rodriguez uses a grateful and content mood in her memoir. @CAPS2 describes her house is warm and says that \"family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" Rodriguez is grateful that @CAPS2 had people who cared for her when @CAPS2 was growing up. Also, Rodriguez states that the cultures in her neighborhood had \"solidarity\" or unity. @CAPS2 was happy that everyone in her neighborhood got along. Rodriguez says that her parents came to @CAPS1 \"selflessly\", and this shows her appreciation for their decision. Furthermore, the author states that @CAPS2 is grateful for her parents \"love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS2 describes her parents as courageous and having strength as well as perserverance. Finally, Rodriguez says that her parents \"turned this simple house into a home\". In summary, the readers can see now Narciso Rodriguez's positive mood in her memoir. In the memoir, the mood the author creates is peaceful. @PERSON1 says his family has a warm home, which means it's nice and quiet. Where @PERSON1's family lived, the different cultures that lived in the neighborhood were friendly with each other. In @PERSON1's family, they had countless extended family members who usually joined the family at the table for a nice meal and family get together. @PERSON1's family welcomed many people to their family. @PERSON1 was very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. His family had many rich culinary skills. Their best skill was cooking, which was fun and relaxing to them. Finally, growing up in the environment in New Jersey gave @PERSON1 a great sense that \"family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" Clearly, @PERSON1 and his family were very friendly and did many things that were peaceful. The author definatly created a mood when he wrote the memoir. The mood is love. All throughout the memoir, he talked about how his parents love of him had them leave their countries and come to the US. Because they loved him and wanted him to have a good life they left Cuba, everyone they knew and loved, the jobs they had, and started all over. Their families love turned the house into the home he loves. They brought the culture of Cuba into their new home with decorations and \"the very heart of which was the kitchen. The memoir's mood is the love of the author's parents to him. Narciso Rodriguez, a clothing designer, wrote a memoir on his ideas about family. I believe the author set a very personal mood in this story. This is not unexpected considering it is a memoir however there were few statement facts and everything was personal experience. Along with personal the memoirs also show a very loving and happy lifestyle they lived. For example there was always Cuban music playing along with Cuban food and the parents would always host a person in the house is time to get back on their feet. Above all the author clearly shows his love for his parents. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" With this the author clearly shows the mood for love and happiness. The mood that the @CAPS2 used in the memoir was joyful and motivating at times. The @CAPS2 was able to paint a marviles painting of his parents, by using words such as brave, courageous, strength, perseverance, loving, carrieing, and gracious this shows the reader that the @CAPS2 wants to paint a serious mood. Also when the @CAPS2 went on to describe his home it gave a sence of loving and joyful enviroment or mood. For example the @CAPS2 was able to experince real friendship, and endless celebrations, love and the strength of helping others, @CAPS1 his childhood. The @CAPS2 used a powerful since of mood to show his pashen for his parents and his home. The mood of this memoir is happy and grateful. The narrator is grateful for all the great times in life him and his parents had together. He is happy that said \"times\" were so great.He is grateful for the happy times they had together like cooking, music, and so on. But he is mostly grateful for his parents turning his house into a home. I think the mood in the memoir is love. I think this because the whole memoir is about family, friendships, and relationships. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, \"countless extended family members came and went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily, until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.\" In this quote I believe it is saying that everyone you know and love is part of your family and that you should always be available to help, just as they will too. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is love and that you should always be their for your family and your family will always be there for you. The author sets many moods for the reader in his memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives. The first and most dominant mood is a sense of family or friendship. The author constantly describes how his family's generosity made his apartment into a friendly place with the constant coming and going of relatives, distant and close. Next the author installed a sense of warmth. The very idea of this family moving from cuba into this three room apartment for their son really gives any reader some sense of warmth. Finally the author gives us a Sense of culture. As early as paragraph @NUM1 the author writes...\"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air...\" In these ways, the author reaches out to his readers with the mood of friendship, warmth, and culture to give us a taste of his life with his adoring parents in this small three room house he called home. @ORGANIZATION1 creates a warm, comforting mood in a piece of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. He does this by explaining what goes on in a positive light. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congression of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm homes.\" This quote uses words like celebrations and warm to show that this place was a comforting place that always had a great time. This shows how Narciso Rodriguez created this warm, comforting mood.\" In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\", the mood created by the author is gratefull and family. Throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez talks about his life growing up. Readers read things like: \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage,\" and \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" @CAPS1, towards the end, the author explains that he is very grateful to have his parents: \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\", and \"in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generousity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" @CAPS2, Narciso Rodriguez was greatly influenced by his family during his childhood, and his memoir shows that along with how grateful he will always be. There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage. He talks about Faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community. He speaks of the \"innocence of childhood\" and the \"gratitude for the spirit of generosity\" impressed upon him at a young age. I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he \"groups\" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have. The mood created by the auther in the memoir was showing the feeling he had when it came towards the things he had. In the article it says \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sence that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" Also his family was always happy. In the text it said \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people that were considered family\".Last but not least experiencing the new life even when they left everything behind. In the article it said \"Many immigrants give their children a better life even when it meant leaving everything they loved. In the memoir the author obviously seems to be grateful and thankful because he states it multiple times in the passage. When he is recalling all the memories he had it proves to be a warm and happy mood. The cookings skills that his parents passed on to him he says that he's grateful for and passionate Cuban music he says that he still adores to this day. The author also states that there's not only a sense of family in being a blood relative but in the neighborhood as well. All the different cultures of his neighborhood; Spanish, Cuban and Italian came together in a great solidarity and friendship. The author is so thankful in fact that he's actually told his parents that he could have never done something as courageous as they did. The mood of the memoir is so strong in a positive way because he also writes that there is no way for him to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon him at such an early age. To wrap up his memoir he mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home. I particullarly like this one beacous in this story the author sets a good happy, Cultural @CAPS1 to the story. I @CAPS2 the Culture and how you need to appreciate what you have. And it @CAPS2 what his parents Did for there Children @CAPS4 that they could have a better life in a new country. The author's mood was a very grateful and good mood throughout the memoir. The author loved everything about these memory's. For example, \"and a love of cooking that is still with me today (for which I am eternally gratefu)\". The author shows that he is in a good mood by saying he is eternally grateful. His mood was also very appreciative. For example, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families...\". The author is very thankful and appreciative to his parents that came to the United States from Cuba just for him. He has thanked them many times. The author also shows his gratefulness again at the end of the passage. For example, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\". The authors parents bought a house that was big enough for his family and his mood was grateful due to his parents. Lastly, the authors mood was very thankful. For example, \"It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\". The author shows that he learns family and is very thankful to his parents for that. That's how the authors mood was. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, described the mood created by the @CAPS1. The mood was @CAPS2, grateful, and proud.The mood of the memoir was @CAPS2. For example, Narciso and his parents had to leave there home and Come to the United States where they all Struggled financially and personally living through the cold winters and facing Cultural hardships.However, the mood was also grateful. Narciso was very grateful for his Parents for all that they have sacrificed for him to have a better life and all that they have taught him made the moode of the memoir grateful.Lastly, the mood was also proud. The parents come to the Country with such courage without any Knowledge of the language or the culture, leaving all there families and friends behind. Just so that there @CAPS3 Could have a better Life made the mood and the reader's proud of the parents.These were the moods created by the @CAPS1 in this memoir. In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez portrays a happy mood. First he says how grateful he is for the customs passed down to him. Rodriguez writes, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (And) for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixed with the aromas of the kitchen.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This shows him grateful to his parents for passing on their culture to him. Next he writes about how they regularly had large dinners where they invited neighbors. Rodriguez writes, \"My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). He is happy about how they invited many people over for dinner, and because of this they made many friends. Lastly, he thanks his parents a lot. Rodriguez writes, \"I've often told him of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I thanked them repeatedly. (@CAPS1 @NUM3). This shows his happiness for his parents risking their lives for him to have a better life. Clearly in his memoir @PERSON1 portrays a happy mood. The mood created by the author in the memoir is being together. This mood is created by saying how his parents created a traditional cuban home in New Jersey. Also, when he said that that his parents always kept open arms and door. I think that ment that they were willing to let people stay with them and help them out when they were having a hard time. Also, when he said that everyone in the neighborhood despite there customs came together in friendship. The mood created by the author in the @CAPS1 is supposed to be warm, motivative, and inviting.The mood is mainly set when he describes the warmth of his kitchen \"The passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\"The mood is inviting when he describes his parents generosity by letting so many  people come and share a delicious feast with them \"My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\"@CAPS2, the mood is motivative when he describes his parents perseverance for a better living. \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\"That was the mood created by the author in the @CAPS1. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a mood of thankfulness toward his parents. Narciso tells of how his parents immigrated from Cuba to the @LOCATION1. He tells of the hardship of the sacrifice they went through. In this memoir, Narciso says one line over and over. It is \"I have thank them (his parent) repeatedly (Rodriguez @NUM1)\". He is also grateful for his parents love and sacrifice. In the last sentence he says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" (Rodriguez @NUM1). In conclusion, Narciso is grateful of his parents sacrifice for a better life of their child.  The mood created by the auther in the memoir is that he was happy about his parence sacrinefying to what they wanted for themselfs and thinking about the family and what they needed. Also show them how @LOCATION1 is different from Cuba. They show him how to love because well his mother would invite people who can't find a job can stay there unil they can get back on there feet. This is how the author fells about the memoir. The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, in the memoir was grateful and it had gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" His parents sacrificed their families, friends, careers, and the country they love to selflessly come to @LOCATION1 to give their son a better child hood because they loved him that much. Even though they had to change jobs and take any possible work. They also struggled with finances, harsh northern winters, and cultural hardship that wouldn't give up and that's why the author was grateful, creating the mood.  The mood is nutral in the authors memoir. he speaks about his house and family. He tells the reader how greatfull he was have loving parents, stated in line @NUM1 parigraph @NUM2. The author also speaks about how important his family and friends were/are. The mood is somewhat happy because he was remembering the good times he had as a child growing up with his Cuban family. The mood of this story is happy, hopful, and caring. In some paragraphs, the mood shifted and felt upsetting and gloomy (p @NUM1) \"They struggled both personally and financially.\" At these parts in the memoir it felt sad and hopless to see what struggles they faced. But then it shifted. Narciso used words like, \"courage, selflessly, love, family, and celebration.\" This transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story. They never gave up hope and all the imagrents helped eachother with their problems. This is set a mood of selflessness, and caring which is what the Rodriguez family brought to the United States. The mood that the author in the memoir has created is a soft happy and @CAPS1 mood. He trys to say how grateful and happy about his memoir. An example is \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their Rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am enternally gratefull)\" OR \"Passionate Cuban Music (Which I adore to this day). His mood is also saying that hes happy for what he has because he said that his parents are very couragous and he could of never did what they did. The authors mood is very grateful. In the excerpt by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of his home is created. The mood in his home is always happy, and thankful. Narciso was always talking posetive, never about what is bad in his life. He talks about how his parents had to start over again with their lives to come to @LOCATION1. \"meant leaving behind their familles, friends, and careers...\". This quote meants that his parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1. Narciso and his family have lots of friends like them because they keep there arms open to people. Narciso's mood is set in the excerpt from his memoirs. The story, \"Narciso Rodriguez\", has a comfortable and loving mood. This memoir sounds almost cozy, in some ways. If you read paragraph @NUM1, you can imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when @LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (\"surrogate grandparents\") were around it. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it talks about the Passionate and Cuban music\" that filled the air \"and the \"aromas of the kitchen\". If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is evident in the excerpt. This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what. The first sentence in paragraph @NUM3 says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" That alone says how much love there was in the house. The mood of this story was very comfortable and very, very loving. The mood created by the author in memior was his home, His home was, His house was never perfect but he mad it how he need to be and his parent did too and that's what change it into a home for him and the neighborhood made him learn how to learn how to love and how much sacrifice his parents made him have a loving memior for his home town. The mood created by @PERSON1 in the memoir from \"Home:The Blueprints of Our Lives\" is that of a grateful sense. In this memoir Narciso reflected and thanked his parents for their love and sacrifice for him, Narciso also said that he was grateful for the teachings of his parents such as in the line \"It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family.\" And \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" The mood of the memoir is one of greatfulness and of @CAPS1. This is because the auothor, Narciso Rodriguez says, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" In this quote is saying straigh up how he feels, which is grateful. You can also tell that he is implying that he loves his parents. Another quote that supports my main idea is The author says, \"... There is no way to express my gratitude...\" In this quote, just like the last one the author is saying directly how he feels, which is again greatful. In conlcusion the author uses effective techniques to trap the reader in his mood, which is greatful and @CAPS1. The author of Narciso Rodriguez creates an enjoyably, happy, fun mood.  The author makes every little sentence sound like you actually lived there & or were there at some point. The whole second paragraph is wonderfully written it makes me feel like I honestly was the experiencing his home & the love & kindness of his home. The love & friendship @CAPS1 shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph & as well as the other ones too. @CAPS1 shows so much love & thanks to his family & friends & his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph. Yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence. \"I will never forget how my parent turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 also especialy shows how hard his parents worked to stay up but still did so much to care for everyone else, all right in paragraph @NUM1. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a good mood. It is a good mood and it also explains the hardships along the way, such as moving from cuba to the united States. It was a good mood because the parents of Narciso Rodriguez always let people who needed help in their home until they could get back on their feet, paragraph four. Their is a nice attitude towards everything through good times and bad always a good attitude. Narciso's parents let family and friends over for dinner all the time for cuban cooking and music. Every One has such a great attitudes. This selection has a soft, nice, and good mood. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cool and funky. I say this not to make fun of anyone but to thank them. The author says that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and love for cooking. This piece of evidence is located in paragraph two. The mood is described as joyous, giddy, excited, and elated. This is because the author is starting to figure out what it's like to have a \"family that isn't related by blood but by race and culture. This evidence is located in paragraph @NUM1. The authors parents invited refugees to stay with them until the got back on their feet. His/@CAPS1 parents did this so whenever they needed anything than they would be alright. This final piece of evidence is located in paragraph seven. These are pieces of evidence that describe the mood of the memoir. (And also of where they are located). The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir is understanding & love, because no matter where you are, you can always bring a piece of where your from and place it where you are at present. For example his parents decorated the Kitchen in cuban ways and listened to cubin music. Keeping their hintage going. And he realizes how great and hardworking his parents are, how good they've been to him. Also even if your not blood related, when loved ones come altogether, who care about eachother, thats family. The mood created by the author in the memoir is gratefulness and happiness. He was grateful because of the sacrifice (moving to the US) his parents did for him. His parents were selfless. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" @CAPS1 part of the mood was happiness. One example is when he learned the definition of family. \"But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" Also they made him a home. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\"  The auther creates a very comfortable and happy mood. In the text, it says, \"within it's walls, my young parents parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.\" This suggests that many of the good memories Narciso had were in his kitchen. The text also says, \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family...\" This suggests that Narciso's parents were very caring people, and gave their home a very friendly and welcoming feel. Overall, the author describes the home of Narciso and his family in a very joyful way. Narciso Rodriguez is very grateful of his family. During this memoir he is very excited and thankful for the family he has. Like was said in the memoir \"I will always be greatful of my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 example of how Narciso show that he is greatful is \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, @CAPS2 thanked them repeatedly\". Narciso says he really has a family, that show they care. He appreciates what his parents have done for him. You can tell his very greatful because of the way he expresses himself about his family. \"In reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spint of generosity impressed upon me, and demonstrate of how important family and friends are\". He is a caring young boy. In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, The mood was pretty much the same throughout. The mood in this @CAPS1 of writing was very happy. Narciso Rodriguez was very grateful and happy throughout the @CAPS1. He would always say that he was very grateful for his Parents being all nice and coming over here to the united States from Cuba to give him a better life. Also, his family gave up their friends and family, good jobs and all said goodbye. Just to have a chance at a new and better life. He was also very happy, because even though he wasnt in Cuba anymore, he still grew up with a Cuban cuture. This memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez,\" from \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,\" is very enjoyable. The mood made it really easy to understand and read.The mood of this story is not funky or funny. The mood is like haveing a regular conversation with a person. I like when the author adds little perenthesis, it gives it a personal touch and adds more of a conversation touch to the mood. For example in paragraph @NUM1, \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day).\" Its more of a fun fact or personal note.In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez,\" has a very formal mood, with a personal twist. The formal mood makes the memoir easy to understand, while the personal twist makes the story enjoyable to read. This is how to use mood correctly. The @CAPS1 mood in this memoir is loving and thankful and calm. @CAPS2 is just in a verey good mood @CAPS2 is trying to show his gratitude to his parents for what they have done and given up for him. They made a simple little house into a great home for everyone. They gave up great jobs for him so the could move to america. Him saying that @CAPS2 can't even show How grateful @CAPS2 is in that ther selfless shows his thankful and loving mood In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, there is a main mood created by the author. I think this mood is happiness. To Narciso and his whole entire family, family is the most important thing. No one leaves a family member out. In his neighborhood there mostly lived, Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. All these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso's parents came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. When I read this memoir I felt happy reading it. It let me know how other families who really have nothing, have everything. Narciso's family is very close, and caring for one another, and to them family is the only thing that matters. The mood created by the author in the memoir was, powerful, @CAPS1, and appreciative. The first mood created by the author in the memoir was powerful. \"My mother and father came to this country with such courage\" The second mood created by the auther in The memoir was @CAPS2 ful. \"The congregation of family and friends and end less celebration. The last mood created by the author was appreciative. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrefice\". In conclusion the moods created by the author in the memoir were powerful, @CAPS1 and apprective. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a passionate mood in his experiences of having a \"home\" rather than just a house, and how growing up in such a different community has shaped the man he has become today. Narciso is forever grateful for his parents' willingness to give up their good lives in Cuba and move to @LOCATION1 for the sake of him. The selflessness and thoughtful choices Narciso's mother and father made truly don't have words that are able to describe it. Narciso feels that you don't have to be related, of the same background or believe in the same things in order to be \"family.\" The loving atmosphere of living in the neighborhood of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants was created by the feeling of coming together and having a good time, despite all of the differences. Narciso cherishes the memories he has kept of his childhood very much and will always admire his parents for the sacrifices they made for him. The author, Narciso Rodriguez created a pleasant mood, with a family atmosphere in his memoir. First, he described his childhood home. With the great Cuban music and cuisine, his family, friends and the many celebrations, he painted a vivid image of fun and comfort. Next, he describes his neighborhood. With the many diverse cultures of all the immigrants, they work together, and kindness prevailed. The community would always extend their hands to one who was down on their luck. Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they. Because of this writing style; because of his vivid imagery; Narciso Rodriguez wrote an article that is not only pleasing to read, but that it also touches the heart. The mood that the author created in this memoir is a happy, emotional, and @CAPS1 and caring. The are happy because the are all living together in a perfect place all together. It is emotional because the care and love for each other. They help each other out. In paragraph @NUM1 it states \"these are two lessons that my parents did not just tellme. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basic of my life. And those are some of my reason why the author added mood to this memoir The mood of this memoir is suppost to be @CAPS1 and thoughfull or happy feelings. The author is talking about his past, when he was younger. He loves his past life when he was little because it was full of happyness and good times with his family. you @CAPS2't need to be blood related to be family. All these good people got together and became family. And with this family came the good times. Makeing the mood happy. never being able to thank your Parents enough for giving you that chance to live a happy life is also part of the mood. Thankfulness. The mood created by the author is very welcoming. It is explaining that their home was were all their great memories happened and all the get togethers.  And that their home was a place you could feel safe and protected. The mood I think of his warming, happiness, and joy. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir were happy and loveing. Happy is one of the moods because there are many happy memories in the memoir. \"... endless celebrations...\". Love is one of the moods because in a familey most of the time you love each other. \"I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 on the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS2 of Our Lives the moods created by the author in the memor were happy and loveing. In the memoir, the author definatly creates a mood that you can obviously see. He creates a mood of friendship in pharagraph @NUM1, \"our land lord and his daughter (my baby sitter and first friend), lived a bove us and graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not.\" Also a feeling of love in pharagraph @NUM1 (again), \"there was often somone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.\" The final mood he sets is a feeling of gratefulness in pharagraph @NUM3, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\". Therefore, the overall mood is his appriciation for his family. In the article \"@PERSON1\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood created by the author is both loving and appriciative. In the third paragraph, the author describes that the neighborhood, (mostly made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immagrants) would come together to help one another if they needed it, and how they could be like a family with out being blood related. In the fourth paragraph explains how extended family members could rely on eachother, because they know that they would do the samething if someone else was in need of help. Those are two examples of how the mood is loving. Another way the mood can be loving, and appriciative, is in paragraph five. Paragraph five shows that @PERSON1' parents would do anything to make their childrens lives better. in this case it was leaving friends, family, and work behind and moving to a totally different country. All in all the mood is given off as loving and appreciative even through the hard times of Narciso's life. @PERSON1 remembers his child hood fondly in his memoir about his home in New Jersey. He creates a setting that many people can relate to because of the general feel of family and heritage. The tone in the memoir is nostalgic as he recalls the hard work of his parents, the people who he considers family, the food and the music. Rodriguez recounts his childhood as many people would, telling the readers how grateful he is to his parents and how warm and welcoming his home seemed. Even in the time during segregation in the US, numerous people from different cultures formed the community of Rodriguez's home. This place that Rodriguez describes his welcoming, and that is exactly the mood of the memoir, welcoming. The author recreates his welcoming, warm, musical home for the reader to visit and enjoy.  The overall mood of this excerpt from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 is of love and gratitude. This article shows that @PERSON1 is looking back with love and warm memories in his mind, and there are many examples to show that this is true. @PERSON1 described his home as \"(A) humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but with life and love\" this shows how loveingly he thought of his home because he talked of how the house was always filled with life and love. He described the people of his neighborhood as \"a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants...\" @PERSON1 describes this community with a lot of affection in this quote, which also conveys a warm mood. @PERSON1 constantly talks of his parents great sacrafices and he is eternally grateful. For example, he says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.\" This peice also talks of his friendly home environment where everyone was welcome. He said \"My parents always kept up their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family...\" @CAPS1 the mood this article conveyed a feeling of love, warmth, gratitude, happiness and acceptance In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" there is a certain mood created by the author which makes the story interesting. It has a playful tone with a warm and loving mood. \"@PERSON2\" is about how his mother and father immigrated from cuba in 1956. They moved into a simple house when Narciso was born. Throughout the years, \"this simple house\" turned into a home\" (paragraph @NUM1). The house was filled with the loving family and special friends turning it into something special in Narciso's life, a home. How close his family and friends were added to the relevence of the home. \"It was the warmth in the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love\" (paragraph @NUM1). This shows how special the house was to him. This feeling also adds to the mood because of the appreciation shown. It was where I learned the real definition of 'family'.\" (paragraph @NUM1) The memories from the home make the mood loving and warm. The mood created by the author in this memoir is that if you were born in a place you have a heritage in or family that live close to you that its your decision to move or not. As its states \"home is where one lived as a child.\" in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says @CAPS1 will always be greatful to her parents for their love and sacrifice. It took her a lot to move to @LOCATION1 but @CAPS1 was glad @CAPS1 did. in her house in Cuba @CAPS1 had her first birthday there and \"the warmth of the kitchin this humble house.\" @CAPS1 found the definition of \"family\" and for that @CAPS1 says, \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author explaines how happy @CAPS1 was living in his cuban home. The mood is also grateful. The author is grateful that his parents left their homes and left everything behind to give a better life to their kids. The author states, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The author is happy that @CAPS1 had a real family. @CAPS1 was happy for the simple house they had and was grateful. The author says in paragraph five, \"In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find.\" @CAPS1 is grateful that his parents struggled just to make life easier or better for their children. Those are what I think the moods are created by the author. The mood the author set was warmth and happiness. He describes how hard it is growing up in a racist time, and how the real meaning of family is changed through different points of view. Also he shows how the parents are selfless and open minded even when things weren't going there way. He brings cultural diversity and unstanding to describe the neighborhoods family like relationship. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" From Home: The Blueprints of Our lives the author created many moods. One mood was @CAPS1 and Friendship. @PERSON1's parents kept their arms open for anyone who needed help. so did every neighbor he hade. They all came together and had fun even when they had different backrounds. You hade to make as many Friends as you could to help you live a healthy life.          Another mood that was created was calm. In the house there was \"Passionate Cuban music\" and the air smelled of traditionally Cuban @CAPS2. This was because their family was Cuban so they wanted to keep traditions and make a better environment.             The last mood that their was was harsh and sacrifice. @PERSON1's Parents had to give up a lot like family, friends, job, and have just to move to @LOCATION1.  And when they got here they had to start fresh and take any jobs they could Find. His parents life was hard they tried to make it as good as they could For, their son. It was hard for them but they got by and did a great job. The mood created by the author is a heartwarming mood. This is so because he talks about his parents with a passion of love and respect. To me that is a heartwarming mood. The author talks about his parents generousity, selflessness, and caring ways. In the memoir it says that the parents let friends and family stay with them until they got back on their feet. The author also talks about how the parents left their family, friends, and careers behind just so that the author, their son, could have a better life. If that is not a heartwarming mood I don't know what is. The mood that the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The basis of the authors life has been the @NUM1 lessons that his parents have shown him with their lives. The author is eternaly grateful to his parents for passing on their love of cooking and their rich culinary skills. Narciso Rodriguez admires his parents strength and courage for what they did. The mood that the author portrayed in the memoir is gratefullness towards his parents. In this memoir by @PERSON1, he explains and recalls the home he grew up in. He talks about the small little @NUM1 room house and explains how his parents made it home like. The mood Rodriguez created is sort of reminisant/wistful mood of his days as a kid in the house. He talks about, how his parents \"... both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there are rich culinary skills and love of cooking...\" (@NUM2 2.@NUM1-5). This sort of sets up the mood of the narrator being reminisant and grateful of his life as a kid. The @CAPS1 made the mood in this memoir a nice feeling story and a motivating story. It's nice because of the actual story of the family moving to @LOCATION1, and establishing their own home. The family didn't just live with themselves, it was like all of their friend were like brothers and sisters nobody was excluded from their \"family\". It's motivating because of even if you wern't in their race, they would still lend a hand for people clearly in need. Everybody in the community acted like they were like they were blood related but in reality nobody was. Everybody just cared and love for eachother like parents, brothers and, sisters. The mood in this memoir was it had a nice feeling and it was a motivating story. The mood in the memoir by @PERSON1 his family, and how not all family members are blood relitives. Narciso grew up in a house filled with culture and love. His \"young parents created a traditional Cuban home…\" that Narciso would grow up in. Throughout his memoir, Rodriguez talks about \"the real definition of 'family.' \" @CAPS1 explains how it there were people of no relation who were considered family. His parents would keep \"their arms and the door open to the people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" Narciso Rodriguez tells of his home were @CAPS1 learned that a family is a group of people who care for one another, and that is the mood in his memoir. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, created a mood of joy and happyness. It set this mood because he can have a nice and happy life. I think its happy that he can express his feelings to us the reader. The writer makes me feel joyful because it reminds me of what my family is like. \"My parents always had their arms and door wide open to friends and people we consired family.\" My mother always has her heart and arms open to anyone who needs to be loved. It is also joyful to know that most of his family will be coming to live with him. The writer tells us about how his grandfather and grandmother will be coming to the United States when they are allowed to leave Cuba. That is the mood the memoir set of me to understand it. In this memoir, the author is showing the mood as happiness. The mood is happiness because, the author is talking about how Narciso childhood use to be when he was little. The enviroment of his home, and his cuban culture. He mentions how his family came over from dinner sometimes, and the cuban heritage filled the air. Also how the cuban music brought enjoyment. And that just brought him happiness. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez,\" the mood is very welcoming and warm. An example of This mood is when it said, \"growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense That \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. All of the different cultures came together in friendship.The parents of Narciso came to the United States with a lot of courage. They didn't know any about the language or culture, They just wanted their children to have a better life. They left behind family and friendIn their house, they welcomed all other refugees for their arrival. They still had cuban feasts but he learned the real definition of family. Those are The ways That in this memoir, The mood is very welcoming. The mood created by the author was greatfulness and happiness. When the author was talking about his parents and his culture he said \"and for which I am extremely greatful\" \"Which I adored to this day.\" The author discribed his charector in such a way you could easily tell he was a greatful and happy person. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives a certain mood was created. The type of mood that was created by the author is a warm and @CAPS1 mood. It was because of the different things that were happening in this community, and more importantly the house. This house had become a home to Narciso because of all the different that would happen there. like the Cuban music, the constant in and out of extended family members, and the fact that this all happened because his parents selflessly came to this country to give him a better life, even though they had to leave behind their families, careers, in the country they loved. This is the mood created by the author in this memoir. Narciso Rodriguez creates a grateful and appreciative mood in this memoir. When he talks about his friends being like his family it makes people grateful for their close friends that they have. While reading this many people probably became more appreciative for what their parents did and provided for them.\"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\"(paragraph @NUM1) This quote @MONTH1 make some wonder if they are grateful for what their parents did for them.While reading people @MONTH1 also reflect on if they lived in a home with people they love around them or a house. In the story Narciso Rodriguez by The blueprints of our lives, the author's mood in this story is very happy, generous, and humble. The author is so happy that she is moving to a new, and bigger house. This one she can actually call home. And very generous because her parents moved for her education. and to get good money to make us happy. The girl's parents welcome anyone into their home as family, and thats why she loves them too. But I have to say she's mostly grateful. Because her parent's are doing every thing to make her happy, and they even have to accept getting a job they dont even like. And for their love and sacrifice. And that's what mood the author feel's in the story. The mood in the story was very nice. Narciso Rodriguez was very grateful to his parents and friends because of their great solidarity and friendship. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso said \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Narciso's parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the @LOCATION1. They taught Narciso rich culinary skills that he would never forget. Narciso also learned how much his family and friends mean to him. \"But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" In paragraph @NUM1 it said \"They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life.\" Narciso's friends and family taught him the real meaning of the words family and home. The mood of the memoir is happy and thankful. The author explains how his parents brought him to the United States. All of his neighbors were spanish, cuban or Italian. They were all friends and had a good bond. He had people at his house for dinners. It was here in the United States, that he really understood what family was or what a home was. He couldn't show his parents how grateful he was for them to go through such a hard time to make their childrens lives better. The thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful. The mood created by the story could be described as thanfullness or gratitude. After reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children makes you feel guilty and respectful of your own parents. The author portrayed that they were grateful for their parents and they he or she knew they would never be able to repay them. From what the author says, times at home financially @MONTH1 have been tough, but because they had such a loving family, everything was alright. It makes me happy and proud to think that my family plays a huge part in who I am. The mood that is created by this story is admiration. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez from Home by the blueprints of our lives the mood is homely and friendly. The mood of friendliness is displayed from his passed In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"... the very heart of which was the kitchen.\" This is where he had memorized his culture's distinct type of food. Also his mood is from the music. In paragraph two it states, \"@CAPS1 Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This shows the culture lurking and dancing through his house of his childhood. Lastly the mood is interpreted from his family. In paragraph four it states, \"... @LOCATION2 graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment.\" This shows how friendly and inviting the were. The mood set in this home is friendly and inviting. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from @CAPS1: The Blueprints of Our Lives The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cultural and family. The mood is very cultural because they created the home into a cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. The Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly Passed their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking. The mood is also family because when someone needed a place to stay from their family they would let them stay at their house. The author's mood was happy, thankful, greatful, caring, thoughtful. The mood was happy because he was sharing his life story and what his parents did for him and his siblings made him very happy and greatful. He is very thankful because his parents could have stayed in Cuba and let them grow up there. But instead they came to @LOCATION1 and struggled at first, but the end result was more they could have imagined. He described his parents to be very caring and always put their children before their needs. The author sounds like he is very thankful to grow up here than Cuba because he now sees that he had a much better life. Having a family liked he did he really cheriste the word family. At the end of the excerpt he said \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. This means it was just a random house when they moved in, but when they were done became a home. The mood of the memoir created by the author was that he was very greatful for what his family has done. I know this because throughout the memoir he would always say how much he appreciated how his parents made this house into a Cuban home. I also know that the mood of the memoir by the author is greatful because he said how he liked that his neighborhood had many different cultures such as Spanish and Italian. The author also said \"I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home.\" That is what I think the mood of this memoir is. The mood of the memoir is generally happy. Narciso talks about how wonderful his home was growing up. Narciso speaks about the wonderful music and the food, he talks about his family's happiness and how that house he grew up in became his home. The mood is happy because it makes you feel the love he felt living with his parents in that home in New Jersey. To conclude the mood is happiness, proudness, fondness. It brings back the memory's of anyone's first home and love that was there In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the ton is happy and loving. In this memoir there are many examples about how the tone is loving, and happy, but heres a few. First in paragraph @NUM1 there + two phrases in parenthesees that show how @CAPS1 loved the things like the music and the cooking of his home, and family. \"(and for which I am eternally greatful).\" And, \"(which I adore to this day).\" @CAPS1 wouldn't have added the use things in unless @CAPS1 truly meant it, and if @CAPS1 really loved his home. Also what sets the tone is how @CAPS1 talks about loving his parents, and how @CAPS1 is grateful for them. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,\" @CAPS1 states in the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2. Lastly, the last sentence of the memoir is happy and puts a smile on your face after you read it, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" In Rodriguez's memoir, it has a happy and loving tone throughout it. The mood which Narciso Rodriguez showed in the memoir was thankful and grateful to his mother and father for their love and sacrifice they went through when he was growing up. He was very thankful for their giving arms to anyone who needed them and for their warm attitudes and teachings of what family really defines. Narciso learned this deffinition from his parents, family is or can be anyone important to you and they do not have to be blood related such as a neighbor with a different culture. He is also very grateful for his parents unselfishness by moving to @LOCATION1 for his education not even putting the thought of work in their head. Narciso's mood is represented in every sentence in this memoir written, he was very lucky to have had such a great childhood and \"family\" which he realizes and will be grateful and thankful for everything anyone ever did to help him grow up to who he is now for the rest of his life. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a certain mood. I think the mood created in this story is love. My reason for thinking this is that the story talks about how the parents sacrificed everything to move to the @LOCATION1 so they would have a better life and so would their children. Another reason why love is the mood is because he talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still consider them all family. Lastly, I think love is the theme because he shows an undying gratitude towards his parents for his wonderful childhood and making the place he lived in feel like home. That is why I think the mood the memoir creates is love The mood is set to a sad feeling. Filled with poverty the auther sets it up this way. There is a mood of love too. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" It also says that they learned the real definition of family. this is why it is set too a sadly love mood. They were an immigrants. This memoir is inspirational. In my opinion I think that the author sets a loving mood. Here are my points to consider. First of all he explains how much he loves his parents. An elaboration of my point is that he uses strong words to show that he loves them alot. For example \"I've often told them of my admiration for thier strength.\"@CAPS1 of all he talks about his family and the love they shared. An elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had. For example \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language.\" @CAPS2 of all he explains how much his house meant to him. He talks about the memories he had there. For example \"I will never forget that house...  or the many things I learned there\". In conclusion thats why I think the author sets a loving mood. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love I think that this memoir is about happiness because in paragraph @NUM1 he explains how fun and happy his home is. And his family cooks together which he really appreciates and @CAPS1. I also think this memoirs about love to because through out the whole memoir he talks about his appeciation and love for his family and friends. And thats why I think the mood of this memoir is happiness and love. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author sets a mood. The mood that is set is happy, greatful, and loving. In paragraph @NUM1 it states \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\" The author is very happy his parents did this for him. In paragraph @NUM2 it states \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\". And in paragraph @NUM3 it states \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" The author loves his home for all the memories and friendships it holds, and is greatful to his parents who provided him with it. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the memoir gives a loving and thankful tone. The loving and thankful tone is snowing the definition of \"family\". In paragraph seven the author states, \"and for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This shows that the tone is thankful for what the parents had done and love them at the same time. As I aformentioned, the tone is love and thanked. The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, in his memoir is happy and warm Rodriguez (multiple times), lovingly discribes his childhood and the people in it. In the memoir, he talks about the house he grew up in and the love in his home. Rodriguez describes the warmth of his kitchen and every thing that went on in it. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\" (paragraph @NUM1). Rodriguez also describes the conection between the family and friends around him, \"countless extended family members came and went...My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us\" (paragraph @NUM2).With all of the love in this memoir, there is also a serious tone when the author describes the difficulties his parents had to face, to give him the best life that he could have. You can tell that Rodriguez has great respect for his parents. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, there is a clear mood created by the author. For instance the Cuban background set the mood of happiness.

Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This shows her love and happiness from her Cuban background. Also another mood set by the author is greatfulness.

The word he uses can tell they are from the heart, the memories of @CAPS1 parents as well as the rest of his family, influenced his life, and he learned the true meaning of family. The author created many types of moods in this @CAPS10. At one point in the @CAPS1 he creates a sweet type of @CAPS6 by describing his home, him @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, how the kitchen was the heart of his house.At another point in the @CAPS1 the author created a @CAPS5 @CAPS6. He creates this @CAPS6 by telling the @CAPS7 about how his Family took everybody in. His Family Always helped their Friends and when family visited they always had a place to @CAPS8. He also created a sad tone by talking about how he'll never beable to express his gratitude twards his parents. Finally at the end of the @CAPS1 the author creates a sincere @CAPS6. He creates these sincere @CAPS6 by expressing his gratitude twards his parents for being so selfless.Those are ways the @CAPS6 changes during his @CAPS10. In the memoir of @PERSON1, the author shows a lot of mood throughout the story. Happy and grateful stand out as the two most important moods.      @PERSON1 is very grateful throughout the memoir. He is grateful of his friends and family. His caring and selflessness parents. Also all of the hard work they do and what they gave up back in Cuban in order to come to @LOCATION1. His dad worked in the laboratory and his mom studied chemichal engineering. Lastly he is grateful to have grown up in a really good home.          Another mood is happiness. In the first paragraph parenthesis mean that he really enjoys cooking and Cuban music. He is also very proud about his Cuban @CAPS1 and how his extended family stays with him.            This memoir has a lot of mood in it and it makes it a lot better. The mood from the auther her Life was very good @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in a simlpe house cuba. @CAPS1 Do alot of fun thing with her family. her grateful parents their Love sacrifice and I've often @CAPS1 Told then that what did was so much courageous and her parents told her that the early age the demonstarat how important family and friend are. @PERSON1 is a memoir of family memories growing up in an immigrant neighborhood. Throughout the reading Narciso created a very grateful and excited mood. One example of this was when he said that he was forever grateful of his families Cuban cooking.Another example of this mood was when he was getting excited over the fact that his whole immigrants neighborhood was lending out a helping hand even if you had a different @NUM1  also portrayed greatfulness by how that even though he hasn't met his real grandparents, that someone in the neighborhood supplanted them and treated @PERSON1 like a grand-child. That is the mood that @PERSON1 showed in his memoir of his family. The author's mood is happiness the author is really happy to do this @CAPS1 about this family that is grateful of liveing in their country that they love with all their hearts and they will never forget their country. The mood Created by the author in the memoir is in my opinion pure happiness and Love. Narciso Rodriguez says that \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sence that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This family shows this many times in this memoir, they always had people over, like the landloard's daughter Alegria who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter she went over to eat dinner very often. Narciso also States that \"also at the table were sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would know my \"real\" grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)\" @CAPS1 also always has many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and \"countless extended family members came and went\" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2 \"My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family\" which explains why the house was full of happiness but I think the house was full of love because \"I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home.\" I think the authors mood is, honored, proud, loving, and appreciated. I think the author mood is part of being honored because (in paragraph @NUM1) he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and makes others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because, he explains (in paragraph @NUM2) how much he appreciates his family and his parents to have open arms and help thoughs in need, and to have such great parents that he does'nt even have words really to express to commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Through out the story the author alway's mentions How loving his partent are and you can see in the passage that he picked that trait up with the words and expression he used in the story to express the fact of his parents being loving to their family and their @CAPS1. Those are what I think are his moods and the reason for them. The mood created by the author in the memoir is that every time he talks about his new home his mood changes. For example paragraph @NUM1 rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day). Every time there is parentheses means that the mood of the story changes when he talks about his life in cuba and the new life here in america. He is grateful that he is in america and that his parents left cuba where they had a better life. In the memoir, the mood created by the author is very understandable and true. Throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents. In the memoir Narciso explains, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Narciso's parents had to go through a lot of hard things. They had to leave their country, their friends and family, and they had to pretty much start their lives over again. But his parents stood strong in those hard times. They cared and taught Narciso many important things. The mood the author sets is very loving. The author had very incredible parents that he is very grateful for. The mood that the author creates in the memoir is loving and grateful. Narciso tells the reader about how grateful. @CAPS1 is for living in @LOCATION1, and that even though @CAPS1 didn't live in a big, nice house, her family is what makes her love her house. @CAPS1 loves and appreciates what her family did for her. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. @CAPS1 will never forget the house because it is where @CAPS1 learned the real definition of family. \"It is where I learned the real definition of \"family.\" And For this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.  In the memoir, the author doesn't just describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the relationships he made. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place.The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place.If we do as they do, we can all live in unity. In this memoir the author created a mood of what it was like in his childhood home. Based on pharagraph @NUM1, cooking was a big part of the author's childhood life. The author describes a home filled with the smell of the kitchen and the \"passionate @CAPS1 music.\" @CAPS2 a warm mood that makes you think of home, this pharagraph is the base of the authors childhood. The author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants that were friendly and always helped each other out. In pharagraph @NUM2, the author describes a mood of family, friendship and acceptance. Even though the people of the neighborhood weren't all the same, they except one another as equals during a time of racism and segregation. Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremly difficult. It is hard to get good jobs when you just immigrated and maybe don't have a ton of money. It is also hard to get used to climate change, and learning another language. This creates a mood of hardship and rough times. Throughout this memoir the author creates moods, whether good or bad, of the memories of his childhood. The mood created in this article is a joyful mood. He says, my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today and for which I am exernally grateful. This shows that he is grateful for what he received and the mood is very joyful. Also he says Passionate Cuban music which I adored this day filled the air mixing with the aroma of the kitchen, Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. I mean that the mood is lighthened up a  little when he says all of this stuff. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he sill loves it today. \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air...\" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. \"I've thanked them repeatedly.\" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is. Only a person who is very thankful \"will never forget...\" something. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfullness. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness Here are my three reasons why I think that First of all, Narciso is proud of the way @CAPS2 lives and who @CAPS2 is. It all began, starting with his parents, they are immagrants. \"In 1961, I was born into this simple house.\"@CAPS1 of all, @CAPS2 cherished every moment @CAPS2 lived. @CAPS2 is grateful for all the things his parents did for him and everyone else. \"my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family\".Finally, His parents migrated from cuba. They are known as immagrents because they was not born in america, and narciso is proud and honestly happy for them. Thats why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness. In the memoir there were actually two main moods. The first mood and most prominant mood was joy and happyness. Because throught the memoir the reader learns about the writers family and how greatfull the writer was for her family. An example of this is when the writer wrote: \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir. Meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. Therefor sadness is also a mood in this memoir. In the end, the joyfull mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a sense of where the writer is coming from the reader most consider both these moods. Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and greatful mood throughout the memoir. He did this @CAPS1 never premoting himself, but always thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way where everybody helped eachother. Fer example in @CAPS2 @NUM1, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life. He states, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.\" @CAPS1 writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows apretiation towards them, which then gives the reader a sense of gratefulness. Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes how his neighborhood was like a family. He stated, \"Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In an neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" This @CAPS2 gave me a sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through. So it gives the reader a sense of caringness. Narciso Rodriguez produce a mood of caringness and greatfulness throughout his memoir. There are many moods that the author creates in the story, \"Narciso Rodriguez\", from Home: The Blueprints of our lives. Some moods it creats are sad, brave, and thankfull. The author creats a sad mood in many ways. One way he creats a sad mood in the article is in paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how imigrants leave their families, friends and carrer, just to come to @LOCATION1 to do good and to lead your children in a good place. In paragraph @NUM2, he also says he will always be greatful to his @CAPS1. Leaving your freinds and families behind is a brave action.He also creates a sad mood when he says that all imigrants come selflessly to this country to give their children a better life. The author is showing that he knows how immigrants come to @LOCATION1. He also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things. In This memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives The @CAPS3 explains the definition family as not blood relatives but as people who leave a lasting imprint in your life because of the large impact they had on you and the role played by them in your life portraying a figure of some sort in your eyes As the @CAPS3 descriptively went through this the whole time @CAPS5 was talking about family and the definition of it they were not portrayed as people related to you but just basically people who were their for you the one who gave the shoulder to cry on as in the memoir the land lord and his daughter had put food on the table for the @CAPS6 more often than not and How the whole community had been a family because they acted as one reaching out to lend a hand though they had come from very different backgrounds some more different from each other stood unified resulting in something more they were a family In Narciso Rodriguez from Home the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is @CAPS3 but sad because it says in @CAPS4 one that the bays father and mother where liveing in a One room appartment. But it is @CAPS3 and @CAPS5 because they his parents had him and they had A house feel like a home to him. they tought him how to cook and they showed him diffrent music from his cultere and he adores the music today that information was in @CAPS4 @NUM1 The last thing that made this @CAPS7 @CAPS3 and @CAPS5 was. the naigboors lived together and where there for each other when they need each other. Plus they had all diffrent religons italian, Spanish, and cubain. I got this statment from @CAPS4 @NUM2 that is why this @CAPS7 is @CAPS3 but also at the same time sad. The mood in this selection is prode and happy. I know this from some clues in the text. the first and biggest clue is when the auther states some facts like \"and for wich I am eternaly \"greatful\" and \"witch I adore to this day. Also when she says that \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" it shows how prouud she is. From the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of gratitude and love. The author's gratitude is to his parents for their cultural and selflessness for leaving their family and friends so their kids could have a better life. one line that really showed this was \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today\" (@NUM1). That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line \"Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is constantly creating a mood of gratitude and love in his memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness. Rodriguez explains how appriciative he is of his parents and every thing they have done for him. Making his house a home and always being there for him. He talks about friend ships and familys, but family being the relation ships between their friends even if they werent blood realitives. Overall he thanked his parents and said \"in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. The mood that author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture. He loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home. The author exsplains how his life begain in new jersey and how proud of his parents he was and that he looks up to them and plans on carryinging out the culture and triditions that his family had so that's what makes me think that the mood of that the author sets was happiness and fullness of this familys life, and as I read this passage I was glad and happy for him that he admires his family that much and how happy his life was. The mood created in the memoir could be of happiness, gratefulness and love. The author describes in the memoir how his parents left their country Cuba to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they love (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The author express gratefulness by saying his grateful for his culture and the sacrifice his parents did (@CAPS1 @NUM2). To conclude the author also express his feelings about the house he use to live, you learn the real definition of \"family\", he is really happy about the welcomes his parents use to do when other refugees arrival to this country. At the end the author says \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). The mood created by the author in the memoir was sad because he grew up as a poor boy his family had no money too he was living in a @NUM1 bedroom apartment in New Jersey they were living a heart of which was a kitchen and his parent were both sharing a cooking duties but his parents still remember the traditional way they act in cuba they were in a very poor house it was a refugee place here all refugee live after he thought about going to school and helping his family After he started going to school and he started learning lot's of stuff about love and other stuff and he started learning @CAPS1 because he didn't know how to speak @CAPS1 then he started learning it and he lived in a house thats where he celebrate his birthday at it was very small it was the size of the kitchen and he said he will always be grateful to his family for doing so great things for him and thats the time he was very young he was very proud and he said he will be always be to his parents for there love and sacrifice he told his parent that he admired them for there strength and courag and perseverance so it was a very sad life for him and his parents The @CAPS1 of the poem is very warm and loving The warm memories of his home, filled with passionate Cuban music and the love for culinary arts leave the reader with the warmth and love of the house. The words he uses, like \"adore,\" \"warm home,\"  \"innocence of childhood,\" \"passionate,\" \"congregation,\" \"love of cooking\" and \"celebrations\" lets The reader go away from the excerpt of a  loving and heartfelt @CAPS1 His discussion of the real definitions of family, which aren't only blood relatives leave the reader warm as the paragraph talks about his extended family like Alegria. Sergio and @CAPS2: and his real relatives like aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" is so loving that the @CAPS1 is struck in a strong, final chord of warmth, which leaves the reader satisfied. The @CAPS1 of @PERSON1 is undoubtedly loving Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. \"Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon. The mood created by the author in this memoir is love. Narciso and his family had so much love that they were able to overcome struggles and help others to overcome by allowing them to stay in their home, and live with them. They allowed people who weren't even apart of their family to become part of their family, they loved and cared for other, possiably even more than them selves and gave up everything they had in cuba to come to america for a better future for their children. The amount of love in this house is what turned it form an ordiary house and into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community, and family\" that was created. That is what the mood of this memoir was, and in whom created it. The mood created by the author in this memoir is happy, grateful. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice\" In paragraph @NUM2 \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture.\" @CAPS1 therefore I say the mood of the author in this memoir is happy, grateful. The mood given by the author in this memoir is happiness. In the memoir Narciso talks about how greatful he is that his parents left the one place they love, Cuba, just so they can give there children a better life in the @ORGANIZATION1. Narciso explains how much he loves his parent for the love and sacrifice they have put forward for example \"In Cuba, Narciso, SR., had worked in the laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering. In the united states, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking what ever work they could find.\" Narciso loves his parents for this sacrafice they did and the risk they took just so he can have a better life and this is why he wrote this memoir. The, mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is very @CAPS1 and happy. In paragraph @NUM1 nothing really happens so there is no real feeling. About half way through the @NUM2 paragraph was when the memoir started to get very @CAPS1. It is really @CAPS1 because you realize that he can turn a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home. It says in paragraph @NUM3 that they are neighborhood was made up of, \"Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation.\" It is really @CAPS2 that those cultures could be in a friendly neighborhood during those times. In paragraphs @NUM4 and @DATE1 when Narciso Rodriguez starts to thank his parents it feels as if you were inside that house and your having dinner with their family. Overall, the memoir about turning a New Jersey three-room apartment into a traditional Cuban home was a very @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 story throughout the entire memoir. When I read \"Narciso Rodriguez\" I thought the mood was warm and thoughtful. \"family had nothing to do with being blood related\" I thought that was welcoming and  showed that his parents didn't care who you were or what culture you believed in. He would always thank his parents, because they had left cuba so that their children could have a better life. His parents thought that if they get through the bad time they will enjoy the good times to come and for that he always thanked them. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and appreciative of what he once had. I can tell because every time the author speaks he is always happy, and I noticed not one negative thing was said during the story. An example of appreciating his life is where he states in paragraph @NUM1, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 could tell he was happy because he'll never forget how nice and giving his parents were. Another example of the mood being happy is where it says in paragraph @NUM2, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This shows how happy he was because of how much his parents loved him. My third example in the story is when the author states in paragraph @NUM3, \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" This shows that the writer appreciates how much his parents cared for others, and how much others cared for them. My fourth and final example is in paragraph @NUM4 it states, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant having to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" This statement shows how happy and appreciative the author is, because of how the author's parents left everything to give their kids a great life. And those were for specific examples of how the mood created by the author was very happy and appreciative in the memoir. The mood created in the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez From, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,\" by the auther is all about love and happiness. The memoir is mostly about family and childhood memories. It expresses the authors feelings or love, @CAPS1 the reader feels it to. The author didn't have many material things growing up, or a big house, but there was great memories of love and warmth.The many different memories in the this memoir gave a mood of love and happiness. First of all, it says in paragraph @NUM1, \"... All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" The author lived in a neighborhood with many different cultures, but they put their backgrounds aside and were able to great friends. Also, the memoir says in paragraph @NUM2, \"My parents always their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family...\" This shows that their family was very inviting. They were always having guests, and loved a lot of people and considered them family. The author also says in paragraph @NUM3, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1, the author didn't have a big home but the memories, and environment his parents created ***** what he really remembers.In conclusion, from reading this memoir, you can really feel the loving mood from all of the authors amazing childhood memories, to his great home environment. The author really did a great job of creating a mood of love, and helping the reader feel it. The mood created by the author is a happy and grateful one. The memoir expresses a positive mood and their are no signs, at all, of negativity throughout the memoir. The author created a mood that tells the reader that he does not regret anything from his childhood and he's grateful for his wonderful and caring parents. The author created a mood that also tells the reader that he is proud of his Cuban heritage and everything and everyone that he has grown up around. Narciso has also made a mood of strong feelings toward his beloved parents, friends, and family. The mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning. The authors mood in the story \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, could be discribed as calm, and a little sad. The author is constantly talking about, and remembering, what her home was like when she was growing up. But, now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad. Also, she talks about how \"My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family.\" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them. As you can see, the authors tone in this memoir is calm, and sad. In the memoir written by @PERSON1 the author created a mood, that shines throughout the story. The mood represents the hapiness in @LOCATION3's life when he lived in a three room apartment Newark, New Jersey. In paragraph two, the author talks about how his parents used their heritage of Cuba and brought it to their new home in the United States. @PERSON1 was always greatful how his whole house was revolved around the kitchen. There was always Cuban music and the smell of a Cuban fiest in the air. @PERSON1 was always happy because he was always a part of a family. Through out the tough times @PERSON1's parents went through there was never a shortage of love or the feeling of family. In paragraph six, the author says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" When the author says this, it creates a happy mood, and it flows through out the memoir. Also in paragraph seven he says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This memoir shows that the importance of family and friends creates a positive feeling in anyone's life. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love for family. He writes about how his parents and other immigrants moved to @CAPS1.S.A only for a better life of their children. He writes that in a way which could make the reader feel that he is extremely happy. He also talks about how his parents taught him to cook and talked to him about Cuban culture. He was extremely proud and grateful to his parents to teach him all these. The author writes about how this small simple home was very special home to him and also how much it meant to him. Also this house has been this special to him, by spending his childhood there and also how he got love from his parents in this house. This was the house where he was able to learn what the word \"family\" really meant and also how it made him happy about how he would never in his life be able to forget his family. These love and happiness were the the moods created by the author in the memoir dedicated to his family. Inthe memoir the author the mood the author sets is a thankful soft one The author is thanking his parents in a good way, in a nice, soft, and appreciative way. \"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house with a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always fills the air with not just scent and music but life and love (pg. @NUM1). All you need in life is a little imagination and a lot a help and love. This guy in the memoir got a lot of help in love by describing it in a nice calm way, of thanking his parents for all they have done for him. The mood that is created by the author is joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parent's are immigrants who works hard. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso realized that he felt happy and filled with joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents.\" When you're grateful you feel happyness. This is the mood that I think this author created. The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, and happiness. In the memoir the reader expresses the love and gratitude towards his parents. Not only did his parents love him; they quit their jobs and moved across the world just so they could give their son a better life. The authors parents risked so much for their son. The author states that he is very grateful for his parents, and that there is no way to express the love he feels for his parents. This memoir expresses the love, and gratitude in one's family, and how a little bit of caring can go a long way. The mood of this story is very weird. This story is about different cultures coming together as one. Narciso's parents are very nice and generous. His parents are always taking in @CAPS1 needs a home, and treats them like family. Narciso still has some family in Cuba, and will might be able to meet them until a later time in life. Anyways the mood of this story is very heart-warming, Narciso was also thankful for everything he has, Narciso's parents have a lot of people to feed since, There is more than one family living in their home so It is hard for them. Well I think the mood of the story is great. The overall mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. First, Narciso's parents went through the struggle of coming to @LOCATION2 and starting over. Narciso narrates, \"My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956.\" His parents came from Cuba to the United States to have a happier future. Narcisos family is nice to everyone and everyone in their neighborhood is nice to them. He explains his parents doings. \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" Narciso's parents are happy to let anyone into their home. Finally, Narciso is very grateful towards his parents. Narciso explains, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Narciso is very happy about what his parents did for him. The mood of this memoir is happiness. I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir the author didn't talk about one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1 the author talks about how his parents taught him how to cook and how they gave him a love for passionate Cuban music. In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4.      As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood. The mood created in the memoir was very greatful because of @PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey. He was grateful for the talents his parents passed on such as cooking and loved the heritage they had like their interest in Cuban Music. @PERSON1 must've been very grateful to be surrounded by so many loving people like his \"@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not\" Based on the excerpt of the \"@PERSON1\" by the blueprints of our Lives, That mood created by the author is happness and @CAPS1.When the author restate when the girl says I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. That shows How much @CAPS2 cares about her mother and father and How respectful @CAPS2 is towards them. Anothe example that her mother and father is @CAPS3 and cares a lot is when her mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. That line proves how much the mom and dad care about there daughter. The mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude and happiness. Narciso repeatedly states how grateful he is to his parents for showing him what it really means to be a family and having selflessness and caring. He says, \"In reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" When he is recollecting memories from his childhood he shows how there was a lot of happiness in their home. He says, \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" With his memoir, Narciso creates a great mood filled with gratitude, happiness, and a sense of childhood. The mood in the memoir of the life of Narciso Rodriguez is mostly how the bonds between him and his parents, and everyone around them got them through tough times. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 he states that in their neighborhood \"cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship\" And how \"immigrants extended helping hands to people, who were not only their own kind, but who needed a helping hand.\" The author says that in his community many different cultures came together and help each other through racism, and other tough times. He says that \"family\" isn't just those you are related to blood, but those who are close to your heart. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. Narciso is remembering all the great times he had in his house. His parents are very friendly and welcoming and treat everyone like family. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, \"my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language or the culture.\" This is what happiness really is. Narciso and his whole family have such a great attitude and just want to be friends with everyone.  There are many times in the memoir when author created a mood. One time that the author created a mood was when he described a traditional cuban home. In which the kitchen is the heart of the home. Also when the cuban music mixes with the aromas of the kitchen. This gives off the mood of hunger for great food. Another time when the author created a mood was when he described how he lived in a close-knit community. This shows how the author grew up helping people. While being helped in return. This gives the mood of wanting to help someone in need. A third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people. His family always helped people who were considered family to them. This creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them. Clearly, there are many times when the authour creates a mood for the reader. In this memoir, the mood created by the author was heartwarming and apperciative. There were so many parts to this story that made me feel so warm and made me want to say \"aw\". For example, in paragraph @NUM1 where it states, \"was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not nessecarly of their own kind, were clearly in need\". This line showed me how much love there must've been. Also, that everyone cared about everyone else. When the author is showing how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can tell how grateful the author is this is shown extremely clear in paragraph @NUM2 where it states \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.I think this story made me realize that you need to apperciate what others do for you. This author was so greatful for her parents, and that is shown very clearly in this memoir. Narciso Rodriguez is very gracious and compassionate, and he will never forget the monumentous risk his parents made to leave everything behind to come to @LOCATION1 so he could have a better life. Narciso recalls how his parents had to take any job they could and \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" This past @DATE1 I was in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and I had to stay with this family. This family was great to me, and I will never forget their uncany attitudes to give me whatever I want. When I read this passage this family immediatly popped into my mind. Narciso's mood is unbelievably grateful to levels most people don't have the chance to experience. Narciso will never forget his parents and the sacrifice they made for him. The mood in the memoir is that Narciso appreciates what his parents have done for him. So he can have a better life. he also appereciates that they turned there simple house into a home. he thinks that wat they did was very courageous. Marciso is thanks his parents. For Sacrifice there life in Cuba. To make his life better. The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyfull and grateful. The author is joyfull because in stanza two Narciso states \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This shows that the childhood of this person was joyful with the culture, family, friends, foods, and smells. This person is very grateful for all of the things he parents did. Such as when the author states \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this period of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" This shows that the author is truly grateful for everything the parents had done for him or her and he or she is really joyful now thinking back and makes the mood of the memoir joyful and grateful. The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and being thankful because in the memoir in paragraph @NUM1 when he is saying \"growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. It means that it doesn't matter if you aren't blood related because it only matters if you have love for one another and you care about one another. Narciso is just saying that he is proud of what he is today, and loves and respects his culture, and that he has people to love and has people who love him back. Narciso Rodriguez creates a very humble, caring, and grateful mood in his memoir.The humility shows when he describes how, although rich and inviting on the inside, his house was simple and \"modest\" on the outside. All of the home's warmth and comfort was crammed into a three-room apartment.The sense of caring was demonstrated throughout the whole memoir in the way that Rodriguez referred to not just his blood-relatives, but the friends and neighbors whom he considered \"family.\" Of his parents, he says that they \"always kept their arms and their door open\" to their community.Rodriguez expresses his gratitude again and again, especially in the sixth paragraph. He states that he could never thank his parents enough for the valuable lessons they instilled in him, especially their generosity and sense of community. These three themes set the mood of this memoir. The mood created by the author is quite comforting and homey. As the author describes his life growing up at home as a child, he seemed to have a pleasant life. when he (the author) ex plained how greatful he was to have learned all the things he had from his family, it portreyed a simple but very enjoyable mood. When the author spoke of his family and friends that came to dine in the apartment that was made into a home, Narciso created a very relaxed mood. Everyone who came to the Rodriguez's home was welcomed and treated as if they were close family. The overall mood of this memoir is friendly and welcoming just as the Rodriguez's home was. In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he develops a very warm, comforting, and happy mood of where he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez tells us of how his parents came to the states and after living in a small, one room apartment for a while were able to move in to a three room apartment where he was born. He speaks of how is home was decorated in the traditional style, about the Cuban music always playing and of how his parents taught him to cook. Rodriguez also tells us of his diverse neighbor hood but of how they all came together in unity. Everyone cared for one other and they helped whoever was a need. If someone needed help they received it and people would sacrifice for others. The memoir depicts that Narciso Rodriguez grew up in the love of his family. The mood created by the author is loving because it talks about how generous and caring his family is. \"... @LOCATION1 graced our kitchen table for meals...\" That quote gives you an idea of how close everybody is \"...family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\"  @CAPS1 around Narciso treats him like family. He learned what family really ment by living in this house during his childhood. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" In the memoir you can see how Narciso loves his family and friends. Overall the main mood of this memoir is loving. The author creates a simple but peacful and happy mood with the way he describes things. in paragraph @NUM1 he describes his home growing up in great @CAPS1 that makes it feel almost like you are there. also words he used to describe the neiborhood like hardworking, and close knit, help set the mood for the story. It makes you think of your own family. Home is where the heart is, many of said this and many more have meant it. In the non-fictional memoir by @PERSON1 talks about the importance of family. Narciso pats many moods into the story and describes them with such grace. \"Friends and celebrations both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" (paragraf @NUM1) This gives a sence that for him home was the safest and happiest place for him to be. \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open the the many people we considered family.\" (paragraf @NUM2) This gives off the mood that his home was a very careing place and that anyone that they loved was cared for. \"It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'.\" (paragraf @NUM3). This sets the mood that he was never really alone that he had people with him at all times that cared and loved for him like he loved for them. \"My parents turned this simple house into a home.\" (paragraf @NUM3) The mood  that was created by the author is something that not alot of people have. In the selection Narciso shows that he is thankful for being cuban living in the united states. His parents moved to Newark, New Jersey after living in cuba  to give their children a better like. Narciso has \"a love of cooking\" because he was raised with his parents both cooking and having cullinary skills he was passionate of cuban music which \"filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen\". To Narciso Growing up in his envirenment family had nothing to do with blood relative and, was more as someone who  you think of as to being like family. For Narciso there was no way for him to show the gratitude and generosity that he got in such an early age. And how important he learned that family and friends are. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and grateful. He is grateful that his parents give up everything that they had just to give him a better life. In the memoir it says: \"They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and the country they loved.\" he is happy because he has an opportunity to have a better life and that he learned the real defition of family. In conclusion the mood for this memoir is happy and grateful. The mood is well many different things. But mainly the mood is loving. I think it's mainly loving because in the memoir at both the begining and end, Narciso talks about how nice, sweet, and caring his parents are. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" And in that sentence you can see that both Narciso's mother and father would always welcome people into their house. In the story, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, The @CAPS1 created by the @CAPS2 in the memoir was a very soft @CAPS1 because they are all greatfull for what being going on with their lifes like the @CAPS2 said in paragraph @NUM1 \"It was in this simple house tha my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feas (Albeit a frugal Cuban feas) always filled the air with not Just scent an music but life and love. it was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\". And for this, I will never forget that house towards gracious neighborhood or the many things I learne there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn the simple house into a home. In the memoir the mood created by the author is gratefullness. I know this because in the memoir it says, \"But, in reality, theres is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" This evidence shows how Narciso Rodriguez was grateful which is the mood of the memoir. His parents taught him how to love his culture, (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" The way the author puts the words and uses them shows the mood of the memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez's @CAPS1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a very optimistic mood.Narciso describes how even though \"at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States\", he and his \"family\" (which included foreign neighbors) still overcame adversity. In addition he describes how even though his neighborhood shared different cultural backgrounds, they still lived together as a family. Lastly he describes all the memories and celebrations that helped shape his house from a living space into place of love and friendship. It is real easy to tell that Narciso loved his family and friends all the same in a way that shaped his life. I was in this simple house that myparents welcomed other refugees to celebratetheir arrival to this country and whenI celebrated my first birthday. I was in thewarmth of the kitchen in this humblehouse where a cuban  feast always filledthe air with not just scent and love.It was here where i learned thereal definition of family And for this,I will never forget that house or its,I will never forget that house or it's graciousneighborhood or the many things i learnedthere how to love, I never forget this house. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is a clothing designer who grew up in @LOCATION1 with all different immagrets. The mood of it is that home isn't a physical space but relationships. \"Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" (@NUM1). He had a: \"Close-Knit community of honest, hard working immigrants..\" (@NUM1). I think Narciso would be a clothing designer if he didnt grow up with these people. The mood the author created was gratefulness. Narciso he is grateful for his parents sarrifice to live in @LOCATION1. This gave him a better life. The auther writes, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Also, he admired their strength and perverance of his parents. In the text it says, \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and preseverance...\" @CAPS1, he says that he will never forget how his parents turned a house into a home. That is the mood the author creates in the memoir. The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir was regular becacuse in the story (Narciso Rodriguez) he explains his life a little to the reader he explains how they lived in cuba then to america and the boy also explains how he loves his home, and celebration and heritage in america the boy talks with  like same kind of smat tone beacse he's really explaining his like then about really now and hear he likes is so theres no anger in this story.  In this article the author kind of gave a both happy and proud mood. He loved where he came from. Where he was raised, and mainly the life his parents provided for him. He adores his parents and couldn't be more gratefull. They turned a house into a home. They didn't thousands to be happy all they needed was each other...and they did. He is what he is and that's extremly proud of his Cuban life and family. @PERSON1 uses a very happy tone and mood when talking about his home. ...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and For which I am eternally grateful). Narciso is very happy he learned such great cooking in his childhood. \"Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\" (@NUM1). Being so happy made this such a warm home in @CAPS1. \"I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" (@NUM2). Narciso summed up his entire article in one sentence and creating what most people feel at home. At my home I feel everything Narciso does because its not were you live its how you live.\" In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is calm and they are happy. I think this because they talk mainly about the good thing in their childhood. They also say how much they loved thier family. If you don't love or have a family as a child you would not be happ and they were. My last reason is they were most grateful for their home and how their parent turned a house into a home. This is why I think the authors mood is happy and calm. I think the mood is happiness because when she was talking about he cooking skills and how she was listening to cubin music in pertheisis it said stuff like which I still love today. When she said our house became a home I think that ment that they are happy settled in theres not alot of stress and everyone seems comfortable. She kept say how much she was thankful for having such great parents and a great house. It just made me think she has to be really happy with her family her house and her life. She must be happy with her life here in @LOCATION1 The mood of This memoir is positive and careing. The reason why this story is caring is because they @CAPS1 all the people stay there and they aid them until those people could move. And the reason why this story is positive is because The parents are always having fun cooking cause that's their favorite thing to do and their always haven fun @CAPS2 those are the mood that is in this momoir In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from the book \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,\" The author was very happy and grateful. I know he is happy in this memoir because in paragraph @NUM1 he writes \"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.\" This is a happy setting where the author grew up in. The author was also very grateful to his parents. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 he says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. This shows the emotions the author felt growing up. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, loving, content mood. This mood is created by Narciso talking about what a great and happy life his parents made for him. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says \"the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. It just sounds so happy and loving to me. He also says things like \"It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extened a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Thats another example of the loving happy mood in this memoir because hes talking about how people were so helpful and gracious to anyone in need and it makes me feel so happy that people are like that. I really enjoyed reading this memoir because it was all about peoples love toward eachother which set a very happy, light-hearted mood for me. The mood in this memoir is a very relaxed and happy mood. Narciso is always happy in the house, there was always the smell of food, and his parents cooking. There was always a strong sense of family and the house too. In pharagraph @NUM1, Narciso said that \"growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" What he is saying is that you don't have to be related to be family. Anyone close enough can be considered family. He also felt that you should always help people in need. That is what his parents, they always help people when they need it. and were always willing to share everything they have. That is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love. The mood that was created @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 is a happy, loving mood. The reason I say this is @CAPS3 if you read the passage you'll see that in his home it wass all about love and care. So in the end they have mad a Home and a @CAPS4 relationship together and with other people. the authors family @CAPS5 in their home people that they considered Family, this right here is a mood well a caring mood. The mood created by the author in the memoroir is gentla and proudness. The author explains of how he felt of his parent that risk everything in order to give him a better future according to paragraph @NUM1. The author feels proud of being from Cuba through the whole memoroir. He feel proud of being Cuban by explaining the things he does and things that they share by his culture. Last but least he feels thankfulness according to paragraph @NUM2 becouse, through his parents and things from his country he learned what family really means, he says \"... I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home\". Through the whole memoroir the auther show proudness of wher re he came from, from his parents, country, and his neighborhood. In the memoir, the author creates a mood of love and community. In paragraph two the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional, passionate, and congregation. These words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes. It gives me the feeling that I could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger. These themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love. The mood created by the author is happiness and gratefulness. Reading this made me feel very thankful. The author thanks his parents several times. He talks about how he learned how to cook from his parents and says \"and for which I am eternally grateful\" in paragraph @NUM1, and in paragraph @NUM2 \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.\"I think those specific quotes from the memoirs show how grateful the author is feeling. Reading this made me feel grateful for what I have, and think of all my parents did for me and sacrificed. I also think this sentence from paragraph @NUM3 supports the author wanting you to feel grateful. \"They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\" I also think happy, because the author is looking back at his life and states \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This made my mood become happy. The mood that they author creates is kind of happy for what he has. \"In our neighborhood, despite costums elsewhere, all of their cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" The quote @CAPS1 how the author thinks of the different cultures uniting together. The mood created by the author is a loveing and careing mood. in the second paragraph he describes the the house as having the rich culinary cooking of his paroents the passionate cuban music filled in the air the aromas of the kitchen in there warm home. he tells that in there house they have feast also the many immigrants they invite into there house until they can leave by them self or fine a place to live. he describes family has nothing to do with blood relatives every body in there neiborhood is family and they care for each other and care for any of the people who need help at the end he says \"I will never foget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" he tells how they taught him love and real defination of family he describes there house as being a Warm house.  The mood of this memoir is grateful and content. The author @CAPS2 this mood with his quotes that @CAPS1 puts in. \"I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey.\" That @CAPS2 that the author did not care that much about house looks, price or its location. \"It was here where I learned the real definition of family... [that it] had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" @CAPS1 is grateful for all the people that @CAPS1 now considers his \"family\". Also, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life\". That @CAPS2 right in the quote that @CAPS1 is feeling grateful! The author also puts some phrases in parentheses, just to add a bit more, \"(after which I eternally grateful)\", \"(which I adore to this day)\". Those show @CAPS1 is happy and grateful with his life, and last this next quote @CAPS2 that his \"family\" members were all grateful for each other. \"It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necissarily their own kind, were clearly in need\". The mood created by the author in the memoir was loving and caringness. Repeatedly throughout the memoir, the speaker Narciso Rodriguez which show what his family did after migrating from their native country, Cuba to their love. As said his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family, knowing that they would do the same for them. They cared for their children's future, by leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. All though \"they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.\" they had to do what they thought was best for their children. Their simple house was the best place for them to be together as a family. \"The warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love\". This memoir made me connect this family to mines how similar it is. Without love it isn't a family, thats why at the end of the word \"family\" the i, l, y stand for \"i love you.\" This memoir gives me a sort of cozy and comfortable feeling. When it talks about a family being not only people that are blood-related to you I think of my friends and the people I can count on. They are my family too. He also talks about how a house is not necessarily a home, not without memories, your family, and something or someone that you trust. Lastly, he tells us about how greatful he is that his parents brought him to a neighborhood that he would soon learn to love. This piece makes me think about and appreciate my family, and my home. The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood was a good feeling. To explaination of how he lived @NUM1 reality. Having family come live with you till they get back on their feet. Having family all around you. Realizing you turned your \"house into a Home\". Endless celebrations that encompassed, both form a a backdrop to life in their warm home. \"they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in their country they loved.\" \"The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved.\" \"In Cuba, Narciso, Sr.. Had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering.\" In @LOCATION3, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times.\" Is what I thought the author in the memoir mood was. The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving, caring, and gratefulness. Throughout the memoir the author continuosly mentions how grateful she is to her parents. and how much she loves them. She says that \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The author means that she's thankful her parents love her enough to give up their home, jobs, and friends, all to give her a better life. She also says that \"what they [her parents] did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done.\" Narciso is stating that it takes a lot of carage to go forward to an unknown futue, and she's very greatful that her parents did. The quote show the loving, caring, and gratefulness expressed in the memoir by the author. The mood is a mixture of things, it's really hard to say withe all the emotions the author throws around. But however the strongest feeling is unity, and family.I'm Not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is I think something that can be described by several. One of course is unity, or as he says it, \"great solidarity and friendship\"it's rather sweet how he charectorizes family as something as the bonds you make withe people in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family s always first. So in a way I think his way of thinking comes from his culture.But also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say \"happiness is nothing without appreciating it\" and as he says \"I learned the real defnetion of family\" so apparently he knows real happiness The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy because the atsmothsphere is filled with family and friends also joy and happyness. The considered everyone family even though the times were not the greatest for everyone also his parents gave up a lot so he could have a good life in @LOCATION1. He is very grateful for his parents bringing him to @LOCATION1 so he could have a good life even though had to leave their life in Cuba to come here for him. This is the mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood created by this memoir is a relaxed caring kind of mood. Several parts of this work emphasize this mood. The author often writes about how he loves his parents for their selflesness. This emphasizes the mood, and he repeats it many times and the repetition helps build mood as well. A final thing that helps the mood is how he describes how everyone in his nieghborhood was kind to each other. In conclusion, there are many things in this work that emphasize a relaxed, caring mood. Within the walls of narciso, her young parents created there traditional @CAPS1 home, There heart was the kitchen. Narciso parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on there rich culinar skills to narciso she love to cook. Quite the countrary narciso neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish Italian immigrants at a time racism. her parents came selflessly, as some immigrants will do, to give their children a better life. They sacafised leaving their family friends and careers, in the county they came from I think her memory is a nice, happy one becuase with those memorys she knows what her family went through. The mood created by the author was love from his family The author describes \"a love of (cuban) cooking which is still with me (the author) today\" and how \"Passionate cuban music which I (the author) still adore today.\" The author got this love from his parents. Another way the author created the mood of love was by talking about how his \"parents always kept there arms and door open.\" I know that it takes a lot to be able to let anyone into your home. The authors speaking very lovingly at this point in the story. The author also says that he \"will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship The mood that the author set during the story was love. I think that this was a really good mood to set in a story. I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. He wants to tell us about what they did for him. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home.' The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 is different and uneek to other I have heard. I belive that the @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 is trying to make is happyness, and selflessness, and grateful. I think this because he describes his parents As selflessness and takes everyone in to theire small Apartment. I also think he is creating \"warth\" by saying that his first birthday with his parent Are comfortting That is the @CAPS1 I belive the @CAPS3 is trying to create.  c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage.  The mood in the memoir is grateful. It is grateful in a few ways. One way is in paragraph six he says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says \"my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him. Those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful. The mood  Created by the author in the memoir is a happy One because in the memoir Narciso was happy with with all her parents did for her and the neighborhood was a peace one, every body reached out to help who ever needed help. The memoir looks back on his childhood, with fondness, so I'd call the mood whistful. Yes, the author creates a whistful mood, by talking about his childhood home, friends and family. But... whistfulness only lasts until the end of paragraph @NUM1... after that it becomes a greatful mood, where he's giving out thanks and describing what his parents went through. If it is possible to have two moods, then this memoir does. The moods are both whistful and greatful. Yes. The mood of the author and the memoir is greatful. The author is very greatful for his parents. He is thankful for his parents because they gave up their life for him. They moved from their country so that he could grow up in @LOCATION1. His parents quit their jobs and came over all for him. He is also greatful for his extended family and friends. They are the ones who he eats with, plays with and etc. He takes care of them and they take care of him. They are his surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles cousins and friends. He is also thank full for his culture. All his food along with traditions come from cuba. The author is greatful. The mood created by the author is both @CAPS1 and love. At first the mood the author created was @CAPS1. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"They struggled both personally and financially.\" Narciso explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live in @LOCATION1. So by reading the excerpt based on the poverty and struggles his family faced makes you grow @CAPS1 for them. I also chose love. In the excerpt it states. \"It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" @CAPS3 the excerpt the author explains the love he learned to form for the \"family\" @CAPS3 the neighborhood. Therefore that's why I think love is another mood created by the author. These are the reasons I chose both @CAPS1 and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt.  The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in mostly all of the paragraphs he talks about how much he loves his parents and his cuban culture. Narciso talks about how his parents made his everyday house into a home. That is why I think Narciso is happy in this memior. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen.\" The author is very happy and satisfied with the family he has and want his family has done. The author appriciate what his parents has done to other of his parents that immigrated from Cuba. He dedicates what he has learned such as cooking, manners, and friendship to his parents. The author \"admires the strenght and preseverance and have thanked them repeatedly.\" overall the author could not had a better family then this, they showed them how to live and that is what a families should accomplish. Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blueprints of our Lives shared his feelings, traditions, and Love he shared with his family growing up.Narciso and his @CAPS1 and dad were cuban. they shared their cuban traditions with eachother and were warm and welcoming with eachother and other people. Narciso's family was generous to other people and shared with everyone. they were all kind to eachother and lived a traditional @CAPS2.Narciso emphasized a mood during the memoir .. The love and meaning of family. In this memoir it talks about what the true meaning of selflessness and a home really is. At the beginning of this memoir they talk about how their parents knew the struggles of a life. And would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet. It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house.Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive. His parents loved to cook and taught Narciso how to. They also play traditional Cuban music. Also, they taught him to be selfless. They would invite people over even if they weren't the same race because it didn't matter to them. The mood created in this memoir is love and unity. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) \"... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" This means that they were close, loving, and unified. This memoir gave me the feeling that just a house is not a home until there is love. \"Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen\". This also gives me the feeling of warmth and love. In my opinion the mood is created by the auther in the memoir by the setting and describing her child hood, where she was born and why her parents came here. The reason I think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. Some examples from the excerpt are, \"In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey.\" Also, \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being blood relative.\" The author is very thankful for her cuban heritage and her home is about relationship then just space. In this memoir the mood created the setting. The mood the author created in this memoir was very proud. I could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says, \"My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that because he is talking about how his parents left every thing basicly for him. Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either. He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride The @CAPS1 creates a mood of happiness in the @CAPS2. He states memories of his child that made him happy. He mentions the love that he had of cooking with his parents. He also mentions music as being passionate and that he still adores it even to this day. He also describes how good his neighborhood was and how they were a close knit community. Then he startes to explain that a lot of his family was not just blood related but how it included other people. He then explained that he's parents were very self sacrafising people. So it was a very good mood the @CAPS1 wrote the @CAPS2 in. The mood the @CAPS1 creates is happy. He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up. His parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life. Also the feel of his home reflected on the mood. It was a warm and safe environment in paragraph @NUM1 it states, \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.\" @CAPS2 can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and family-like.      The author goes to describe his family, which were loving but poor. His family supported him by growing up in a happy loving home. They cooked nice food, and invited the relatives over to eat. The author show that no matter if your rich or poor, you can still have a closely knit family. The mood created by the author in the memoir would be describe happy and thankful. I say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless. They always helped out people in need. The author loved how he grew up with his cuban culture and how he would never forget it. He said that was one house hold he would never forget. There is a mood created by the author in the memoir.One way in which the mood is created is by explaining how the warm life in the narrator's house was created. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This helps create the mood of the memoir because it is explaining how the narrator grew up.Another way in which the mood is created is by showing how caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This gave the memoir a light and happy mood.A third way in which the mood is created is by showing how friendly everyone was with each other. \"In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" The narrator explained how friendly and open everybody in the neighborhood was with one another.As you can see, the author of the memoir created a late mood in the memoir. In the memoir the authors tone is loving. The way he describes his Cuban heritage and culture is full of pride for being Cuban. In @LOCATION1 two he states that he is eternally grateful for having had his parents \"rich culinary skills and a love of cooking\" passed on to him. Then at the end in @LOCATION1 seven his tone is once again loving and grateful. In the very last sentence it is noticeable. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" In this memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\", by Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is happy.The mood is happy because everyone in the memoir are enjoying their lives and their not worrying about anything. As explained in the memoir, even when @PERSON1 and Rawedia had to start their lives over entirely, they didnt hesitate. Their family were happy, they partied, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they \"always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family.\" In this memoir Narciso enjoyed his life and looked up to his parents for everything they did for him. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso exclaimed that he will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, which showed their happiness in this memoir. In the memoir Narciso rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.  I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. The author does an excellent job for creating many moods in this memoir. One of the moods, is love. Love is a mood in this memoir because @PERSON1's parents took ten people who needed somewhere to stay, because they know that those people would do the same thing for them. Another example of love is when @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM1, \"they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\" The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which, is another mood. It does this by having the author point out how little his house was, and how his parents did everything they could to give them a better life. It really makes one look back, and see how much their parents have done for them. Well first the authur feels happy and exsited but he also feels sad cause he is moving to @LOCATION1. In 1961 he was born but In that time he met a friend which was his Babysitter and she was his first friend she lived up stairs from them he has alot of family members but wen he moved to @LOCATION1 his mom and dad took his people that need a home Just until they can get back up on there feet he wants to see his grandparents that cant leave until 1970. But he told his mom and dad he will always be grateful to them for their love and sacrifice he often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than he could have ever done he also often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance andt he thanked them The mood would be loving and carring. When @CAPS1 was a child growing up in @LOCATION2, his parents treasrd familey and friends. They taught him to always lend a helping and and to alway keep his door open. \"Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was maid up of mostly spanish, cuban, and italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States.\" It was a close knit comunity and everybody knew everybody. Nobody was a stranger. \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us\". His parent's instilled How important familey is and friends. In the memoir 'Narciso Rodriguez' the mood of it was happy and was meant to sorta touch someone. In his memoir he explains something he found fun and amusing that he still does today \"a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore today)\". \"In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship\" this shows the neighborhood he lived him was happy and united. \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language of the culture. They came selflessly\" this shows that he wanted the readers to know how caring and loving his parents were. There is a warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1. This mood is portrayed in many ways. One way the mood is portrayed is by telling us about @PERSON1's parents. And how there home is always open or how theres always ton of people at the dinner table. Another way they portrayed this mood is by @PERSON1 stating \"there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity.... the demonstration of how important my friends and family are. This is how they show the warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1. The author of Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso Rodriguez made the @CAPS1 feel happy and welcome. When he talked about the different cultures and races coming together and becoming a solidarity made the @CAPS1 feel welcome to everyone no matter what race you are. When he talked about his Culture and house and having people over for dinner everynight just felt happy and welcome. When he showed his love for his home and culture his parents had shown him made the @CAPS1 feel uplifting. that is how Narciso Rodriguez created @CAPS1 in the memoir, by talking about happy uplifting topics. The mood that the author gives through out this hole artical or, memoir is happiness and family. All during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family. In paragraph @NUM1 he says \"It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\". And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" the author keeps on saying how much he is thank ful to his parents and how he loves how they were able to give him all they had to offer. That is what he ment when he said he couldn never show how much it means to him. The mood in the memoir is love, family and happiness. By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that \"they take anyone in until they are back on their feet\", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the \"mood of the story. In the article \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the author talks about the home that they grew up in and the sacrifice and selflessness that their parents have. The mood of this story is happy in the author really shows how much of the love their parents and what they did for them. In paragraph two when they talked about how they love Cuban music and the culinary skills that their parents had, that was passed on to them and that they love so much. Another example of the mood of the story is shown by paragraph four when they talked about all the people they had at their kitchen table and how they were so helpful to the people that they met through where they live. The mood of the article \"Narciso Rodriguez\" was happy and loving to all the people this person has ever met from that house. The mood created by this @CAPS1 is, It makes the reader think About his family And what they have sacrificed for you. And ot makes you feel warm @CAPS2 It makes you think of family and friends. And your culture. And It also makes you @CAPS3 thinking of All the @CAPS4 your family has to make for you. And It Also makes you happy @CAPS2 It makes you think About all the fun you And your family has together. All In All It's A great @CAPS5 that makes you feel a flood of emotions @CAPS2 It makes you think of the best thing on earth, family And friends. The mood created is happiness & pride. Like in paragraph @NUM1, it says, \"community of honest, hardworking immigrants.\" Being honest and hardworking are two qualities to have. And in paragraph @NUM2 \"they cpme to this country with such courage.\" @CAPS1, courage is a good quality to have. So pride & happiness are the mood. In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is a loving one Rodriguez is looking back at all the great memories of himself and his \"family\" when @CAPS2 was young.When living in new @CAPS1 as a child, Rodriguez lived in a very loving home, and a very loving neighborhood. Rodriguez refers to the people living in his neighborhood as family, claiming \"... 'Family' had nothing to do with being blood relative.\" @CAPS2 always had neibors an friends over which @CAPS2 considered to be \"family.\" The was alot of love in his neibors, and so @CAPS2 grew up with a lot of love around him. But, of course, @CAPS2 loves his parents the most.In this memoir Rodriguez is thanking his parents for being so selfless and loving him so much throuout his childhood. Rodriguez is looking back on how great of a childhood @CAPS2 had, living in a great loving neiborhood, with parents that love him alot.Narciso explains the true definition of family in this memoir, and thanks his parents for loving him as much as they did. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong. Narciso's mood mostly has to do with his family, friends, and most importantly his culture. Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there. Second Narciso loves his home. He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his \"real\" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir. The mood in the memoir by @PERSON1 is happy, loving, and upbeat or lively. Happiness is seen by the reader when he Is ex plaing the way many different cultures \"come together in great solidarity and friendship\" @PERSON1 is happy he grew up here and is happy with everything about his childhood in this neighborhood. The author loves everything about this neighborhood. @PERSON1 especially loves that there are always people around their table and extended family comes to see them. @PERSON1's writing is very lively and he writes with great passion. The fact that the author puts so much happiness, love and life into his memoir is what makes it so interesting to read and what makes the mood so fantastic. In the memoir the mood that was created by the @CAPS1 was saying Family is the most important thing in life. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifise. That means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family. The @CAPS1 is trying to say that it is better to have family than money because in this memoir it talks about his parents leaving Cuba with no money no job but for them being together it gave them hope and now they live in a @NUM1 room house with their family. With out family life would be much harder to deal with. The author's mood of this memoir is extremely thankful and appeciative. He said he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices, and mentions what struggles they had, beginning in a one room apartment then affording to move into a three room apartment for him to call home. He explains how his parents started their lives entirely over in @LOCATION1, and needed to take whatever work they could find. They were able to endure their hard times with the faith that this struggle would help lead themselves and their children into better times. The author had so much admiration of his parents strength and perseverance. He learned the true meaning of 'family\" and about how to love. He was really appreciative for all he had, and the lessons of generosity and how important family & friends are that his courageous parents had taught him, that had also become the basis of his life. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a family mood. Rodriguez talks about how family always visits. The memoir states \"countless extended family members came and went...\" (paragraph @NUM1). He also explains that family isn't always the people related to you. Rodriguez says that his neighborhood \"came together in great solidarity...\" (paragraph @NUM1). Rodriguez says that he is most grateful for his parents \"for their love and sacrifice\" (paragraph @NUM3). Narciso Rodriguez really creates a mood filled with love, caring, and family. In the @CAPS1 from \"Home: The Blueprints of our lives,\" @PERSON2 creates a very distinct mood. I think the mood of the @CAPS1 is Warm, caring, comforting, and very loving. The author's home is very family oriented, but not to just blood family. His neighborhood was all family when \"Racism was the norm and segrigation prevailed.\" When Narciso Rodriguez discribes this the @CAPS1 sounds comforting and loving. He @CAPS2 \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.\" This brings a happy, light feel to the article and coforting as well.When Rodriguez @CAPS2 \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,\" the mood changes a bit. Now it's admiring, grateful, and compationate. As Narciso Rodriguez discribes his parents Struggle so he could grow up @CAPS4 nicer than they did you can feel hes very grateful and loving. The mood is happy, loving, and full of compasion at this point This is the mood created by the @CAPS1 by @PERSON2 from \"Home: The blueprints of our lives\" In the memoir the author sets up a happy mood while remembering his child hood home. He only recounts good things and happy memories in the entire memoir. He also speak of cherished childhood memorys and how good his cummunity was and parents. The mood in the story is very happy. The author is thinking about all the good times he had growing up. He is talking about how he had such a good life in the house. How his parents came there as immigrants and made a life for themselves and then him. Another reason he has a happy mood is because he talks about his family coming to @LOCATION1. He talks about how his parents taught him how to cook. He thanked his parents because he was so happy they created a family not just a home. And throughout the memoir there is a constant mood, which is happiness. In the beginning of the memoir, @PERSON1 describes his home, about how it started to how it became a wonderful \"home\". He said it had \"a passionate Cuban music\" and \"amazing aromas of cooking\". Then in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 says that \"he loves his parents for their love and sacrifice\"; and he continues saying how grateful he is toward them. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\". This is the mood expressed in the memoir. In the memoir the author creates many moods with in it. In the text the first mood he created was caring because in paragraph @NUM1 it says \"countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us.\" This shows caring because they would let anyone that was family and wouldn't care. The next mood he showed is being grateful because in paragraph @NUM2 he says\" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice\". This is him showing that he is grateful because he says it in the sentence and he also tells the reason why he is grateful to them. These are the moods the memoir created. I think the mood of this story is warm and loving. Narciso's Parents never had a big home in the United States but they turned a small house into a home.In a @NUM1 bedroom, two family house in @LOCATION1's parents created a traditional Cuban home. A lot of cooking hapened in the house. Family was always around which must've been fun, and all of this hapening with Cuban music playing in the back ground. \"@CAPS1 the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen. Narciso makes his home seem like a very loving home. In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and all the family that ate with them. Narciso also talked about them cooking. I think the moods peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house. The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir was, gratitude towards his parents.In the memoin the @CAPS1 thanks his parents for raising him the way they did. In the article he thanks them by saying things like \"my admiration\", \"my gratitude\", and \"generosity\". all these statements are true and they reflect his mood towards his family.In conclusion, the mood was alot of thing but, i choose gratitude because it reflects how he feels about his family the most. Narciso @PERSON1 so proud he was Cuban immigrante and how his parent did so much for him. he realized that (in paragraphy @NUM1) family had nothing to do with being blood relative. And How all culture just came together as great solidarity and friendship doubt to when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in United @ORGANIZATION1. He learned the true meaning of family. How his parent turn a regluar house into home that he loved. He was grateful how his parent made so many sacrifice that turn something into life time expenence that he will never forget. He was happy how little thing turn it great memories, that he can't wait to tell the world. The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness, safety, and care. Narciso had parents who loved him and a very close-knit community. All the descriptions of his family cooking and family neighbors eating together is enough to make anyone feel happy. Throughout the memoir, Narciso emphasizes the care of his parents. You know Narciso's parents loved him as of his attitude toward them. In paragraph @NUM1, when he writes, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,\" shows his parents' care for him. When the author writes, \"In our neighborhood,... all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.\" These two sentences give the reader feelings of safety and once again emphasize care. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of happiness, safety, and care. The mood created by the author in the memoir was greatful. The memoir was all about how Narciso Rodriguez admired his parents courage, selfishness, culture, heritage, strength, and perseverance.  Narciso said, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" @CAPS1 also said, \"But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" Not once did the authors say anything negative about his experiences growing up. The memoir focused on how @CAPS1 is so greatful for everything his parents did and sacrificed for him. In conclusion, the mood created by the author of the memoir was happy and greatful. In the memoir, the author creates a sort of grateful, appreciative mood. Throughout the memoir, Narciso repeats how grateful he is to have such courageous parents. For example in the first few sentences of paragraph @NUM1, \"My mother and father come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\"  this shows how grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life. I would feel just as grateful For my parents if they had done this for myself, just as how Narciso felt. The mood created by the auther in the memoir are love, happyness, and @CAPS1. Love is one of the moods because they welcome people in need \"My parents always Kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, Knowing they would do the same for us. Happieness is one of the mood because Narciso is pleased with parents. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and secrifice.\".  @CAPS1 is one of the moods because all every one in the neighbor hood got along. \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship.\". The mood the author created in the memoir is very significant. He expresses love, appriciation, and unity. Narciso shows a lot of love not only to his parents, but to his culture. He stated often about how thankful he was to grow up around cuban food and music. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says, \"...Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today,\" and, \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" @CAPS1 he showed appritation toard his parents. Narciso often states how much he admires them for their bravery by coming to @LOCATION1. He talks alot about how they turned their simple house into a home in paragraph @NUM2. Finally, unity was shown a great deal in his community because they were mostly all cuban, spanish, or Italian imagrents, and they tended to stick together. Overall, Narciso really learned what the word \"family\" means. The mood created by the author was happy, The love Of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. I will always be greatful to my parent, for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could ever done. They @CAPS1 me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. The author's mood is happy and grateful of there parents to give the author a better life, and leaving what's behind. In @PERSON1 from: Home: The Blueprints of our Lives the author creates a warm and loving mood. When @PERSON1 talks about his parents and how they \"always kept their arms and their door open\" that sets a loving mood because if one is so generous and caring to do that, it means they love you and they care about you. Also at the end of the memoir Narciso says that he \"learned there about how to love\". @PERSON1 now says this about his house because his parents were always so up beat and caring that they showed him what love is. Being loved makes all people feel good inside. The mood of the author in the memoir are grateful and thankful. Narciso life seem original like others would have. It was a simple house they started, turned to a warmth home. Narciso appreciated his parents brought them to this land, Cuba, selflessly care for their children for a better life. Although they is struggling but they are have happiness. His parents often welcome neighbors and relatives to join the dining. family to him that he be learned is not just his parents, sisters and brothers. It's neighbor surround you and treat you with respect like a family. This is how Narciso Rodriguez felt of worthy to have a home like that. He felt grateful and thankful for his parents love and sacrifice. He admired for his parents strength and perseverance. He'll never forget the gracious neighborhood brought him memories and his parents turned this simple house into a home. The author in the memoir mood was happiness because they bought a New house in New Jersey. They had a born baby in the house her @CAPS1 is Narciso she @NUM1 years old. There family is happy. There parents are from cuba. They live in a beautiful house that has @NUM2 bedrooms.  In hous There, familys are always happy. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very relaxed and happy. This is shown in @CAPS1 @NUM1.In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the memoir states, \"the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in a warm home.\" This brings a very calm mood of how their home brings them together.Another example is in @CAPS1 @NUM3. @CAPS1 @NUM3 states: \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" This sentence gives a \"welcome home\" and loved mood. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and warm. This is shown in two ways: the selflessness of the parents and the true meaning of family. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, is forever grateful to his parents for starting their lives over so he could live a good life in @LOCATION1 This is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when he explains that his parents loved Cuba but left so their children could have a better life in @LOCATION1. He gives his thanks to his parents in paragraph @NUM2. This feeling of gratefulness contributes to the warm, happy feel of the piece.      Throughout the piece Narciso explains to us the true meaning of family \"'... family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,\" he states in paragraph @NUM3. In paragraph @NUM4, he explains that family means those who care for and about you and stick by you no matter what. This feeling of family definitely helps to make the piece feel warm and happy. The author of the memoir creates a very loving, peaceful, and happy mood in the story. It is always saying that his house was always filled with friends and family. This gives the story a very loving mood and shows how they are all there for each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to lif in our warm home.\" This sentence shows that the home is very loving and warm. Lastly, the mood that Narciso has throughout the memoir is very greatful. He is always saying how much he appreciates what his parents did by moving to @LOCATION1 to create a better life for him. That is the mood of the memoir throughout the whole passage. The mood in this memoir is very moving and heart-felt. By the way the author writes about his family @CAPS1 can just feel the warmth and love that his family provided for him \"... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today.\" @CAPS1 can just tell by this quote how much of an impact Narciso Rodriguez's parents had on his life. It also explains how crafted his parents were and how intelligent they were. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @PERSON2 most deffinatly loved his family.  Though out this story there is a certain @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. like how these people got there dream home and this was it. How there Parents Came to this country not knowing the language or have a good edication but Still becoming succesful and living in this house. Where these people learned to love. and the best part having family near by. The mood of this article created by Narciso Rodriguez in \"The blueprints of our lives.\" Is selfessness, admiration, gratitude, and thankfullness. In paragraph @NUM1 it takes about how his parents did his out of love, for her children, not for her. It also @CAPS1 the friend ship of all other imagrints trying to start lives in america. As it States in paragraph @NUM2. This article is fille d with love and respect for family and friends, that is what the atheur was saying. The mood created by the author in the memoir are pretty good. The author shows that he really does appreciate his parents and thanks them for everything they've done. He calls his home a warm home. He remembers the inocence of childhood, congregation of family, friends, and endless celebrations. He states that he had a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. And I think what he's trying to say is you dont need to be blood rellated to be family, just love and care about someone. The author of the memoir is thankful of her parents and to the rest of her family. I know the author is thankful for his parents because in paragraph @NUM1, the author says, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they loved.\" @CAPS1 reason why I think she is thankful for her parents is because they made their liFes worse to make the authors life better. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, it says, \"In the united states, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever they could find.\" The last reason why I know is because he basicly says it in the last sentence of paragraph @NUM3. It says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. That is the authors mood in this memoir. In the memoir narciso rodriguez by The blueprints of our Lives The mood the author created in the memoir was grateful the author created that mood because he was and is still grateful abought how his parents left behind their family and friends and Jobs so that he can have a better life also the mood is grateful because they passed on their rich culinary skills to him. Also he is grateful for livving in a simple house with all those wonderful neighbors and freinds. I think the mood created by the author is grateful because this is a memoir of all the good things in his life and all of the stuff he should be gratefull for having. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a happy and excited mood. This is because he is sharing family memories and those of his home. He is happy about them because of all of the good times he had in it. One event he was fond of at his house was his babysitter and first friend Alegria. Narciso shares times hes spent with Alegria and in doing so shows a mood of happiness. When the author talks about the kitchen and the Cuban music it brings an excited mood to my head. I imagine some exotic food cooking with a sweet warm smell and parents talking over the passionate Cuban Music. Narciso Rodriguez's life seems to be one that is very interesting and exciting. I wonder what he's doing now. The overall mood created by the author in the memoir was courage, and perseverance. First, Narciso Rodriguez's parents traveled to the United States with absolutely nothing; they had no money or background information about the @PERSON2 In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso states, \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture.\" Narciso's parents would bravely step into a new world where they didn't know anyone, they couldn't communicate with anyone, and they didn't really have any ideas as to what was going on. The Rodriguez's also persevered through the @CAPS1 challenges of racism and segregation, here in this country. In paragraph @NUM2, he states, \"at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed...\" @CAPS1, Narciso's parents had to get through problems with people, and they also had to fight through the mental challenges, due to racism. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that his parents were always \"braving the harsh winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.\" His parents had the courage to persevere through new weather and financial struggles. The overall moods that Narciso Rodriguez created for me were bravery and perseverance. The moode the author has in this memoir is happines. He states that growing up around in the envirnorment gave him a sence of family, he says that here in my house felt lik cuba. He and his whole family have respected each other and others. Thats the authors mood In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the @CAPS1 of Our Lives created a mood that was calming and the author was passionate in what he said and made a happy mood. \"my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich  culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)...\" This quote shows that the mood was cheerful and calm. The mood the author created was the friendliness of family and friendship between the family and how other people would join them into his family house. The author made the mood like an instilled enviroement as like he was growing up in \"this environment instilled in me a great sense of \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. While reading Narciso Rodriguez I felt a certain mood. the mood was very serious and grateful. In the memoir Narciso said, \"I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" this shows he is thankful for all his parents Did to make him the man he is today. He also writes, \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" That statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart. It shows he has love for anyone who comes close to him. to add, \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage.\" that says that he thinks about his parents and having heart, and courage, and that is both serousness and gratefulness. In closing I would like to say Narciso Rodriguez is a very grateful and serious man. The mood created by the auther is that of the american dream. It is a very happy and successfull theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants that hopefully had simallar stories. In each paragraph there lines that have relation With freind being family and how his home was phisically quant but emotionally it was a place of love. That enhances the mood of happines in the story. Also the fact that in the story racism and segration were set aside and neighbors were relatives because of who they were not were they came from. That is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that. lastly the story tells times how the parents sacrifice for their sons better life. That has probably touched most of reader close to hom so the mood would now becom very serious. This short memoir is a great story to bring you mood from sad to hopefull and thankfull that you live in a place you can call home. In the excerpt from the memoir \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,\" by Narciso Rodriguez he has a specific mood or feeling throughout the whole excerpt. He mood seemed to be kind of like a happy mood that shows everything even the hard times like \"a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed the United States,\" in a happy tone or mood. He even explained how his parents left their country and friends to live here and have warre jobs in a lighter happier mood. I believe that Narciso Rodriguez likes to look at everything in a happy, light mood no matter what it is. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one. A reason why I think this is by talking about how he and his neighbors (of different descent) All got along very well in solidarity with one another which creates a sense of love. Also when he talks about happy times like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen they are having a good time, laughing, and listening to Cuban Music. Lastly when he and his family take in family or even just really close friends who they consider family conveys a true sense of happiness, peace, and love. The @CAPS1 of this memoir creates a mood that is very touching and meaningful. It shows the hardships his family had to overcome as well as the good that came frome it all. The @CAPS1 states in his memoir, that, although his family was going through tough times, they left their door wide open to family that needed help and always had the thought of others in their mind. He explains how hard it was for his parents to leave their home and jobs in cuba, but that they did it for him, so he would get to live a better life. one more thing the @CAPS1 said in the memoir that was very touching was when he said, \"But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me...\" These words show us how much of an impact his parents action had on him and how they helped him in life. These are some examples of how the @CAPS1 describes the mood. The mood created by the author in this memoir is very appreciative and grateful. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, is grateful and appreciative for his Cuban culture and that is also amazed that his parents could be so courageous to leave Cuba, to come to @LOCATION1. The author shows @CAPS1 is grateful and appreciative for his Cuban culture by expressing the way @CAPS1 feels about the \"passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day).\" @CAPS1 is also appreciative and grateful that his parents were such great cooks by saying \"our traditional Cuban home, the heart of which was the kitchen\" and how \"it was in warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air.\" The author is also appreciative that his parents were so courageous to move to @LOCATION1 by saying \"I will always be grateful my parents love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done.\"The author was very grateful and appreciative for his parents and this memoir for their cooking skills and courageousness. @CAPS1 is also very grateful that @CAPS1 is Cuban and is grateful for his culture. The mood created by the author in the memoir is @CAPS1. He tels us his life in past of the hoas he ust to live in and how much hapines it broght hem. He tels us how they cald the people to selebrate when they cam to @CAPS2 ther first ime. But he dosent only tell us what good time he had he olso told us haw hard it was fur him to live in cuba. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the story has more of a  \"happy\" or \"joyful\" mood.  I chose those moods because one, it showed how peaceful and loving everyone was even if they weren't family, \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" Two, he said how happy he was for his unselfish parents, \"I was always greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more couragous thing than I could have ever done\". Finally, he explains how different everyone was, and yet can get along with each other so well, \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" In conclusion, this is the mood I think the author created in the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez. The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez is eternally grateful to have the rich culinary skills and a love for cooking just like his Parents. His very happy he came from such friendly family. The community and @ORGANIZATION1 comes together to help out those who needs a hand. Rodriguez is grateful to his Parents for their love and sacrifice, and he thanks them repeatedly. His Parents have there arms and doors open to those who will do the same for them. The mood created by the author is very greatfull and thankful. The author shows how greatful and thankful they are in this memoir When they said, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their Strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me With their lives, and those teachings have been the base of my life.\"- In my conclusion this is why I think the authors mood in the story is very thankful and greatful. There are many ways to describe the mood in \"Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives\", by Narciso Rodriguez. First, the mood is family-friendly. This is because in paragraph @NUM1, the author states \"the innocence of child hood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" Also, the mood is very joy ful. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states, \"all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" @CAPS2, the mood of this memoir is defining the love of his family. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" These have been some moods in this story. The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he tells where they live, how there house is, who lives there and the familys names. The mood of the story is happy. They all want to be to gether and be a happy family. They are telling you where the parents are from and when they moved here. There is alot of love in there family. The parents turned a simple house into a home. I think the mood of author in the memoir is thankful, proud and happy. @PERSON1 is extremely thankful of what is has, disspite what has happened through his life. He is proud of his Cuban heritage and is still proud of it today. He listens to Cuban Music and cooks Cuban food. Also his is happy. In the memoir he has a very happy tone because is his proud and thankful. His parents were immigrants from Cuba and he still got the education he wanted, even though his parents went through tough times. The mood of this story is happy. I think this because in the memoir it talks about cuban fiests, being with family, and friends and it seems like its a good time. Also I think this because it talks about good memories wich is always a happy thing. And it's all celebrations and being together wich is always a good thing. In this memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says \"Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful).\" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good. Narciso was very grateful of his parents they had love, happiness, depression and maybe more. The author's memoir was sad, but also a loving memoir. \"In 1961, I was born into this simple house, within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home.\" Narciso loved his parents for making a simple house into a traditional Cuban home. He also loved how his parents made their own home. \"My mother and father had to come to this country with such corage, they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\" Narciso  was so grateful he thank his parent every day that created love. \"It was this simple house that my parents celebrate my first birthday\". He kept the house as a memoir to remind himself of how he came to america. it was loving, caring, and also cheerful. The author of the story creates a mood to help really emphasize the point of his story. Narciso Rodriguez explains how his parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1 and try to find new jobs and start new lives. Rodriguez also explains how he learned to call his neighbors family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures \"came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" @CAPS1, he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always a seated around the table. Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant mood in this memoir. In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. Here is what is.Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because like Narciso says in the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, \"In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lifes over entirely, taking what ever work they could find.\" @CAPS1 of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised into a wonderfly cultural enviorment. An enviorment filled with his \"family\". When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents \"turned the simple house into a home.\" This is what the tone of this memoir is. The mood of the author is happy. The mood is happy because they doesn't really mention any negative thoughts or feelings at all. He mentions throughout the story, how he is so grateful for his family, like his mom and dad. He talks about himself being cuban, and how proud he is to be Cuban. The narrator has a bunch of good thoughts, about his mother and father. He mentioned in the story \"I will alway be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. He always tells his parents of how proud he is of them, and mentions how their basically an @CAPS1. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood. He talks about family, love, and home. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that \"cultures came together\" and that his parents \"always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with \"not just scent and music, but life and love.\" I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too. Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memior. First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents. Narciso explains that \"they had to start their lives over entirely.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. He understands that they only left for his benefit, and he appreciates that. Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they kept their Cuban traditions. In Narciso's three room apartment, \"Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen\" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Lastly, Narciso expresses his appreciation, and strengthens the mood by defining what a home is. He claims that he \"will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home\" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). For these, Narciso is grateful for, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood. In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood of family and caring is set. The first way this mood is set is by the the passionate Cuban music and the home cooked meals. Rodriguez writes, \"passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" (p. @NUM1). This quote exentuates the mood of family because the music and food of thier nationality gives a feeling of comfort. The comfort with you family and to the mood of family. Another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house. Rodriguez writes,\"... I was born in this simple house situated in a two family, blonde-brick building...\" (p. @NUM2). This adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family. This also adds a cozy feel to the environment. Finaly, the mood of family is contributed to by how close their family lives. Rodriguez writes, \"My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby\" (p. @NUM2). Family living nearby contributes to the mood of family because it exentuntes the number of family members which exentuates the mood of family. Based on the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a strong mood of family is expressed. one mood of this memoir was that of a traditional Cuban home. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM1, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced my hardships. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 \"They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.\" The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty and friendship. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 \"It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. The mood of the @CAPS1 is happy. In the memior, Narciso Rodriguez describes the happy and fun times of living in her small home in New Jersey. He describes how his family, which consisted of her mother and father turned their @CAPS2 house into a cuban home and opened the doors to other refugees that were going through difficult times. In the last @CAPS4 Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather. The message the @CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be. The reason I know the @CAPS3 mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life. Her home wasn't big and fancy but as described in @CAPS4 @NUM1 \"It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees.\" In this @CAPS5 he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love. Narciso's once simple house had turned into a home, filled with friends and family. In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a \"blood\" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family! In the memoir, the mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and cheerful. One example that describes this is from paragraph @NUM1. This is where he described his neighborhood, saying \"In our neighberhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" @CAPS1 this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, the author says that his parents came to @LOCATION1 selflessly, to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their home country. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memorice of his home, where he had birthdays, parties, and family. He said that there was the scent of life and love in the air. For this he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of \"family.\" The mood in this story is very happy. In this answer I will show how he created it.Firstly, the author always had a good mood no matter what happened or what his parents didn't do. He had great memories of the kitchen smelling good. He also loved his Cuban music.Secondly, he showed how thankful he was towards his family for bringing him into this world and caring for them.These two things show how Narciso Rodriguez made this a happy passage to read. The author of this memoir created many moods. One mood that was felt is happiness because of the way Narciso Rodriguez described his home to be a place of childhood innocence, family, friends, and endless celebrations. Another mood is gratitude for I have never given up my friends, family, and home and Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to give up their friends, family, and home in Cuba to support Narciso. The last mood is admiration at the fact the Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the @PERSON2, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made the readers feel many moods while telling his insperational story. In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, she uses key terms and phrases to discuss the mood in paragraph @NUM1 she says, \"Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This line puts a clear picture in your head of what it would be like to have lived in that home. Another time Narciso Rodriguez puts a clear picture of the setting in your head is in paragraph @NUM2. She is stating where her parents must live and says, \"braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics.\" This line puts the setting in my mind which makes it more clear to picture the home and setting. Narciso does a great job describing the mood of each location. The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of gratefulness and happiness. The memoir show a pasionate explination of how Narciso Rodriguez's parents Came to the land of @LOCATION1. It shows how happy he is that he can live in @LOCATION1, and lead his own life. He is, and will always be, eternally grateful that his parents brought him here, so he could have a better life. His gratefulness also affects how his parents raised him, as a Cuban. Any mood could have been described here, but, as it states in the memoir, he is grateful for his family. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from home: the blueprints of our lives. The mood created by the memoir are described in many ways. To start of with, \"growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that FAMILY had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" Quite the contrary, his neighborhood was made up mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2've often told them that they did was a much more courageous thing than @CAPS2 could have ever done. Finally, It was here where @CAPS2 learned the real definition of \"family\". @CAPS2 will never forget his house and his gracious neighborhood and @CAPS2 will never forget how his parent turned this simple house to a home.

Then @CAPS5 learne there about love in the simple house and to never forgot how my Parents turned the simple house to a home. So the mood is a mix of @CAPS1, @CAPS6 time's and the alsomeness and more. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is appreciative. Narciso Rodriguez is deeply thankful of his parents and other friends and family for helping him through his life.Narciso Rodriguez repeats several times throughout the memoir the appreciation he has for his parents, family, and friends. In paragraph @NUM1, it quotes, \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage... They came selflessly...\" This describes how he respects his parents so much for their sacrifice. Paragraph @NUM2 states, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age.\" In this quote, Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for loving him and their sacrifice. Then, he gives appreciation to the caringness he had during his childhood, which includes his neighbors, friends, and family. Narciso Rodriguez is appreciative of his family, especially his parents, for the generosity for the betterness of his life.In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is gratitude and appreciation for his parents generosity, care, selflessness, and sacrifice. The mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful. The author explains were he lived as a child very vividly. from the air mixed with the aromas of cuban food to to cuban music the author still loves today. It seems like he had a good childhood. He says his parent were selfless and took in refugees in their home. It gives this story a warm feel like it could almost be your mom or dad. He make the story very personal with all the family members he explains. His parent, did the very best they could for their family. That is how the mood is set. In the memoir what was the mood created by the author.First, I feel that the mood created by the author is both happy and sad. I feel that they are sad because they moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 where they left all of their friends and family and careers they loved behind. They also struggled both personaly and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. Although they were sad I also felt that they were happy. I thought this because even though they moved from the place they loved they have one thing that made them feel at home. I think that it was there home and each other because they have there home Just as they like like, like when they were back home. I felt that the mood was both happy and sad in this memoir. The mood that was crea ted by the author was love, and inspiration The mood was love because throughout the whole story he told his parents that he loved them and was proud of them. he feels proud of them because of all they do for him and the family. So he is proud of them. he is also greatful to have parents like this because they do so much for him they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration this mood is created because of what he says \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perservirence. this means that he is proud of his parents and he is thankful for what they do for him, he says tha he is thankful for all they have sacrificed. These are some examples of the mood that was created. In the memoir, \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\" by Narciso Rodriguez, There are various different moods. The main mood is thankful.           In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez expresses a thankfull mood. In paragraph @NUM1, there is an example of this thankfullness: \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" (Rodriguez, paragraph @NUM1).    This proves how Narciso acknowledges the sacrifice of his parents, and thanks them for it. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states that, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done.\" (paragraph @NUM3). This proves how Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for what they did for him.      In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a thank ful mood. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood, that's sort of calming. The author explains how the house was very comfortable for him. Narsico explains how his parents were caring and selfless all the time. I think that creates a very calming are caring mood. Also in paragraph @NUM1 it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" which again creates a caring mood. The mood the author creeted is gratefulness. @CAPS1 is grateful for many things @CAPS1's grateful for culinary skills and love of cooking that was passed on from her parents. @CAPS1 is grateful of her close-knit community, who are honest hard working immigrants who always extend a helping hand. But the big reason @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS2 her family. @CAPS1 is grateful for her countless family & extended family who joine them for meals and who stay with them temporarily. @CAPS1 is also mostly grateful for her parents. @CAPS1 is grateful that her parents are @CAPS3 nice and always keep there arms & door open for help knowing they'll do the same. @CAPS1 is also majorly grateful for their courage to come to a new world without knowing any of the language or culture just to give their children a better life. @CAPS1 is grateful her parents had to make a huge sacrifice just for her benefit to leave behind there friends, family & careers in the country they love. @CAPS1 is also grateful for both the personally & financial struggle her parents had to go through and braving the harsh northern winters. For her culinary, love of food, family, and parent sacrifices @CAPS1 will be forever grateful. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author was powerful. It had made one feel as though you were accualy there. The author had explained in detail his living enviornment of a small house in a community of other immigreants like them selvs who had band to geather in rough times. During the memoir the author tells about his cuban background, \"Passionate Cuban Music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" @CAPS1 also tells about @CAPS1's deffinition of family. the ones in his community that wernt just blood related but the neighbors who looked after each other. The author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community. and how his simple three room apartment has become a home. The mood of this story was a happy and a reflective one. Many times during the story, especially in paragraph @NUM1, he told us what his parents did, but also after almost every sentence in parentheses he would say how much it meain to him. For example, he says how his parents cooked, and after that: (and for which I am eternally grateful). This shows how much he loved his parents for passing on their culinary skillsIn one paragraph, he starts off the sentence with: \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This again shows the mood of greatfullness, happiness, and reflectiveness from the story. The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was eachother which gives off a great sense of family. Then there is the happiness factor, throughout the story no matter what the sircumstances they seem to be happy because they had family. In the story it says that \"my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy. The mood in the memoir changes. But overall the mood is sad. It tells how Narciso's parents give up what they had for the better of their children. \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.\" Also, most of Narciso's family did not have homes for a while which is sad because they do not have a place to call home.\" Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.\" Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most @CAPS1 in for him. \"The faith that is struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times.\" In this memoir the author creates a mood which- for me, sucked me into this memoir. I think Narciso Rodriguez created a \"home sweet home\" mood. I say this because when he says, \"within it walls, my young parents created our tradition cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.\" it reminds me of my family and how my family loves cooking puerto @CAPS1 food. The smell is like, \"your home\". In my home everyone's execpted and even if you're not realated. Narciso also says this in his memoir. also.Narciso is very grateful in his memoir because his parents immigrated to have a better life. this creates a loving and family mood. Narciso says, \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many thing I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Now that they've immigrated Narciso Rodriguez will never forget his childhood home. There are many moods in this memoir. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the mood is kind of happy, sad and is greatful. Narciso is very happy because he usually gets to spend time with \"family\" and is also very happy that his family hes with him and that more family will come from cuba in a few years. He is sad because he cant see his grandfather and because his parents didn't get to live such a great life as him. He is greatful for being alive for his parents doing everything for him bringing him to @LOCATION1 and he's greatful because he got to live such a great life because of his parents. That was the mood of the memoir. The mood the author Narciso Rodriguez, creates in this memoir is a very apreciative and thankful tone. In this memoir is expressing how thankful he is for his parents moving to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He shows apreciation to them for their selfless and brave deeds. At one point in this memoir he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing the he could have ever done. He tells his parents this to let them know how brave he thinks they are. The mood created by the author, in my opinion, is a happy mood. It is happy because the author gives the reader a great explanation and description of his life at home. The author created a happy mood also because it showed that his parents were not selfish and that they wanted their children to have a better life in the United States. They had left their whole family behind. Also, Narciso talks about how he and the rest of the immigrants had to deal with racism. But, they were still happy and determined to be, so they all work together happily and in unity. I think it shows that the author not only had family in a nice house, but in the neighborhood as well. The story gave me a sense of a really good, close-knit family. Including the importance of one. The mood created by the author in the memoir is pride. I think that the mood created by the author is pride because in paragraph two it says \"...culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" I think it's an example of pride because it says \"for which I am eternally grateful.\" showing that will always be proud of Cuban food.  Another reason why I think the mood is pride is in paragraph @NUM1 it says \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)...\" I also think that is an example of pride because it shows that he was raised with Cuban music and he still loves to listen to it. The mood in the memoir is very uplifting. The story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him. It also shows how happy the family was and how everyone around them were family iregardless of where they immigrated from. In paragraph @NUM1 he says \"Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative\". The author created several different moods in this memoir. The main mood that the author was trying to creat was thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says,\" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This shows thankfulness because she's saying thank you to her parents and everything they have done for her. Also, she is thankful because she started to realize how hard her mom and dad had to work for the house and put food on the table. The main mood of the story is clearly thankfulness. The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and appreciation. Narciso appreciated all that his parents did for him. They gave up a home in Cuba for him, their job and even happiness. Love because they all loved each other alot family meant alot to the family. they said family is people who care for one another even if they are not blood related. it doesnt matter. It's about Love and careness. The mood created by the author in the memoir. First, the mood created by the author is that he love to cook, his parents taugh him how and her is eternally gratefull for his parents. Second, his mother and father \"had come to @LOCATION1 with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. they came to give a better life to Narciso @PERSON1, leaving behind their country they loved.\"third, he parents had a simple house. They always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.In summary, this are the mood created by the author. Narciso Rodriguez wrote fondly about his memories of growing up in Newark, New Jersey. He creates a mood of bliss through his loving and grateful tone. Narciso describes his neighborhood as \"of honest, hardworking immigrants.\" \"Growing up in this environment gave me a sense of family' that had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" A picture of kind, smiling faces is painted by this description of a tightly-knit, ever-willing to hep group of people. Rodriguez tells of his parents' creation of a beautiful home from just a house. \"My parents kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family.\" Narciso's words captivate the reader with a scene of relaxed happiness, generosity, and love. He is clearly grateful for his enviable childhood, and cares dearly for his selfless parents. The peice he wrote has a loose bliss, like eating a delicious truffle. The mood in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" he demenstrates a mood of love. @ORGANIZATION1 shows his love by telling his parents. In the @NUM1 paragraph he says \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance.\" Here he shows his compassion for his parents because his parents left cuba and went to @LOCATION1 to start a new life. Also, they wanted a better education for their children so they left family, friends, everything behind so they could restart their life. Another way how Narciso shows love to his parent is by using what his parents did to him into his life. Narciso used the better education, to have a better life. Now he is a fashion designer. Therefore, in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\", he shows a mood of love in the memoir. In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez, The mood the author created was loved, because he showed that his parents gave up  what they had from Cuba to come to @LOCATION1 for a better for their children. For example his @CAPS1 worked in a labortory in cuba, and his mom was studying chemical @CAPS2 and they left that to live in Newark, @ORGANIZATION1. And the author discribed how he grew up in a triditional Cuban home and how you could smell the aroma of food, and Passionate Cuban music filled the air. And how he lived in a neighborhood of Spanish, @CAPS3, and Italian Immigrants. And he also discribed how his family always kept their doors open for people who were considered family. In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a certain mood. The mood created is love. In paragraph @NUM1 the mood is really shown because Narciso talks about how his family cooked with him, listened to music, and family-friends attends celebrations with him. \"family and friends, and endless celebrations.\" This quote shows how he was given love by his family and friends through these celebrations. In the last sentence of the memoir Narciso fills the reader up with love. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This last quote shows the love given to Narciso. This shows the mood is all about love. The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood that the author was happiness. When example of happiness was that his parents passed on their culinary skills and a love of cooking.  Another example of happiness was that aromas from the kitchen mixed with Cuban music filled the air. The last example was that he grateful for his parents sacrifice and love. The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and grateful. @PERSON1 is grateful that his parents moved to @LOCATION2 to give him a good life. @PERSON1 says that his parents were brave before beginning a new life in the United States and how he wont ever forget how his parents turned the simple house into a home filled with things from their culture. Finally, it shows that the mood is happy and grateful because it says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. So, the mood created by the author was happy and grateful. In the memoir; \"@PERSON1\" from \"Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood is both happy and sad. This is portrayed happy when he talks about his heritage of being Cuban and having the advantage of being born in @LOCATION1. He also is sad though when he talks about how he left his family in cuba to be born in @LOCATION1. He likes that his family lives close by in 1970 when his family was allowed to in Cuba for @LOCATION1.  He also is very grateful for his parents sacrifice to give @CAPS1 the life he has. Allthough liking his neighbrhds he is depresed to be born to a time of racism and segragation like most immagrants faced. This is what the mood was in the memoir of @PERSON1 was portrayed as. The mood created in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is a grateful, cheery tone. As Narciso talks about his parents' Cuban background and tradition, by his tone you can tell how proud and happy he is in his heritage. Also, as in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, he talks very highly of his parents, how they made their house a home, and how grateful he is to have them as parents. The mood makes me think of the color yellow, and of the sun, happiness and warmth. Narciso Rodriguez did a great job setting this cheery mood in his memoir. In the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the author in the memoir. The mood was like excited because Narciso Rodriguez is man that we can tell that he is a man that apreciate what his family did for him. Because in the memoir say that he felt graceful and happy about his culture. He is from cuba, his family are so friendship. His family teach him lots of stuff that why now is have been the basis of his life. His friend have inportant friends. Now in this memoir he express all and also how proud he felt about his family. And his admiration about his family is awsome. he learned with his family how to love others and how to respect. In the memoir he say that he would never forget how his parent turned his simple house into a home. This is how the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the author in the memoir. I think the mood the author set is loving. The story says how there was a love for cooking and a passion for Cuban music. Just how endless celebrations brought life in there warm home. Narciso Rodriguez also had a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. \"In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, although these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" How there parents always had their arms and door open to many people knowing they would do the same for them. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" \"I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home.\" The mood @PERSON2 set for this story is loving. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez had created a very warm and loved mood. He explained a little about his parents when the first came here to @LOCATION1. Narciso also tells us that in 1961 his home was a traditional cuban home. He explains his parents culinary skills, and how he was grateful to have gotten them. Also how there was always music that was like an endless celebration. His parents \"always kept their arms and their doors open\" (@NUM1) to many of whom they considered family. They had know that if they needed help they would do the same. Later in the memoir Narciso gets to a personal feelings of grateitude, and love. He explains how his parents wanted a better life for their family, even though it meant leaveing so much behind. Their families, friends, and jobs in the country they loved. It takes great bravery. Narciso understands this and expresses it freely. The mood in \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives is grateful. This is shown by how Narciso explains in detail the major chronologically ordered events his life. Narciso also includs little sentences in parentheses explaining what he had just said or telling how grateful he was for it. This happens for example when Narciso states: \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" This shows how he is greatful his parents taught him how to cook, which he still does today.

In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits. One trait of the mood is selflessnes and courage. It is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when the author says, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they love.\" Would you be able to throw away your life, into an alien world, just so that your children would have a better future? Doing this would take lots of selflessnes and courage. Also, the mood has gratefulness.

Finally, unity is found in the mood. It is found in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, \"in our neighborhood, despite customs else where, all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and freindship. It was a close- knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.\" This shows great unity in their neighborhood because in other parts of the United States, these three races didn't get alond, but in this neighborhood they were unified.

He talked about how his fascinating Cuban culture was portrayed throughout his home. The author said, \"passion Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This quote shows his love and pride for his culture. In the memoir, the author also tells about his extreme thankfulness towards his parents. He admired their courage. Narciso felt that his parents did all they could to give their family a good life and that they were successful. Narciso said, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This shows that he has a genuine appreciation for what they did. He believed that family is everyone that you love and are close to, not just blood relatives. Narciso considered his community to be one giant family. This memoir had an upbeat tone due to the positivity and optimism of the author. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can effect you as a child and when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why. The mood created by the @PERSON1 in the memoir was to show how happy it was for Narciso Rodriguez growing up. \"here, The innocence of childhood, The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home\" and when the @PERSON1 says \"growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relitive.\" as you can see the mood of the story is warm and tells us about how he had a good Childhood In the memoir there is more the one mood, but this is the main one. First, the author is trying to create a \"no place like home mood,\" and the author succeeds at it. It seems he/she is using memory and telling his/her background. The mood was also very calm and very relaxing for the story. In conclusion this is the mood the author is giving. In the memoir the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described as a happy and enjoyable life of also being able to talk about some serious topics like his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the poeple that live on the street. Also by how he feels so confortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner to call them family. The author creates a very warm happy welcoming feeling by describing how friends and family are always visiting and how happy the family is all the time. The author Narciso Rodriguez never mentions any bad times and shows how kind everyone is. This quote from the memoir proves that Narciso is creating a good mood throughout the story.\"The innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This quote i think shows very well that the author is creating a happy mood in his memoir. @PERSON1's parents came (or emmigrated) from Cuba into @LOCATION1, where they were not wealthy and many racial barriers stop them from getting good jobs. However, @PERSON1, who is writing the memoir, explain how they sacrificed it all so that @CAPS1 could have a better life and how much they help their neighbors and their family.Rodriguez writes a lot about how they always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we (they) considered family.\" @CAPS1 emphasizes this mood, a mood of \"good @CAPS2\" and a neighborly love, how they treated everyone as family. The mood @CAPS1 creates is that where you find the good in a life where there might not be too much good.\" The mood created by the author in the @CAPS1 was both loving and @CAPS2. This was the mood of the story because the author mentioned how his home was filled with a lot of love & how he is grateful for the sacrifice that his parents made for him. (@CAPS3. @NUM1) In his community that was filled with hardworking immigrants came together in great solidarity & friendship. (@CAPS3. @NUM2) The author's parents had come to the country with courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture which he will always be grateful for. (@CAPS3. @NUM3) His home was always filled with life & love. The author said that he would never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things he learned there about how to love. He would never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home... The mood in the passage is @CAPS1. It is @CAPS2 because they can give there child a better life. Next is because Cuba is not a good place to be in. They are @CAPS2 because they get start a new life over. Another reason is they can get Better jobs over hear. They get to live in a @CAPS3 house then @CAPS4. They are @CAPS2 so they can also help other refugees. Finally they are @CAPS2 for other refugees the celebrate there arrival to the country. Based on the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood could be a lot of things. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a @CAPS2 mood. first of all I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it said \"... and for wich I am eternally grateful.\" also it said \"wich I adore to this Day.\" How I know that those where a @CAPS2 moode because if I where to say that it be @CAPS2, also there was nothing saying that @CAPS1 disliked it. Second of all, @CAPS1 would all ways tell his Parents that \"I will always be grateful to my Parents fo thier love and sacrifice.\" also told them \"I've often told them of admiration for their strenth and Perseverance. There for the wood of the memoir is those two reasons why it is a @CAPS2 mood that the author created. There are many ways to describe the mood of the memoir. One way I could describe the memoir is that it makes you fell good about things. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 it says, \"I will alwase be greatfull for my parents love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 mood the memoir sets is a warm mood. I know this because in paragraph @NUM2 it says that his houses were he learned the real definition of family. As you can see, there are many ways to describe the mood of the memoir. In the @ORGANIZATION1 amemorie when in 1961 Narciso was born into a simple house. A cuban home filled with traditions, and the very heart of whitch was the kitchen. His parents who loved to cook is still with him today and for whitch I am eternally grateful. Passionate music witch he adores today. His neighborhood was madeup of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants like his family. His mother and father had come to this country with such courage without any knowledge or the culture. They came to selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and career in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. His mood shows lots of positive thing's about his family being proud what he is and what he stands for having the blood of being cuban. He seems very pleased on his familyes sucsess. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a calm and loving mood. The author first shows a loving mood when he says \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. This shows a loving mood because the parents wanted to give their children a better life by moving to american, even though they were leaving alot behind. The author shows a calm mood when he says \"always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\"\". This quote puts a calm mood because when you think of filling the air with scents and playing nice music it puts you in a clam relaxed mood. This quote also shows a loving mood as well. This is because it explains her love for her family and that @CAPS1 is proud to call her family a family. All in all the above evidents set the memoirs mood as loving and careing. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, The mood of the author created is Grateful, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1 first sentence. The mood the author creates in this memoir is gratitude. The author is very grateful to his parents for all that they have sacrificed for him. For example, they came to the United States from Cuba, without a clue of its customs or language. The authors parent's left behind their careers, their families and friends, just that they can have a better life for their baby. The author's parents let people stay in their home so that they could get back on their feet. The authors gratitude is clearly shown in paragraph six when he says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" The author clearly states that he is grateful for all that his parents have given him. The author also says that he thinks that what his parents did for him was the \"most courageous thing [that he] could have ever done.\" In the memoir, the author emphasized a very specific mood. She greatly emphasized warmth and safety. By warmth, she meant that you were always surrounded by loved ones. It meant something you'll always remember, because it's such a remarkable feeling. By stressing this warmth, it meant that it created memories. The other part of this mood was safety. The explanation of the safety was that you're surrounded by people that care about you, and there's no one to judge you, no one to hurt you, and you're safe from any dangers. I personally love the mood of this story because it's something I long for each @DATE1 down thecape. In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is very clear. In the short story \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood of the short story is grateful and reasonable. In the story a man named Narciso Rodriguez twenty-seven years old migrated from Cuba in 1956 with his parents to come to the United States. When they came they had to live in a one bedroom apt. they could afford nothing else. But Narciso was being very greatful. Even though they had nowhere to to work in places with bigger pay. So they only had little pay to feed there family. Narciso is greatful in paragraph @NUM1. @CAPS1 says \"They struggle both personally and finanacially braving the harsh northern winters.\" @CAPS1 had to settle for what was given to him at the time. The mood created by the authour in the memoir, is the idea of sacrifice and generosity. @PERSON1's parents came to @LOCATION1 as immigrants from Cuba and by doing this took a very risky and difficult journey in order to make @PERSON1 have a more successful life. The parents gave up seeing their families, friends and careers in the country they loved. Narciso displays generosity by saying \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. In the memoir \"Narciso @CAPS1\" by the Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood was happiness because he had his heritage, family and freinds, and the chance to make new lives in @LOCATION2. In paragraph @NUM1 it States \"Skills and love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate cuban music\". This quote is releavant because it shows that @PERSON2 is happy of his heritage. In paragraph @NUM1 it states \"Family and freinds, and celebrations that encompassed them both.\" This quote is relevant to my question because it shows that freinds and family made Narciso happy. In paragraph @NUM3  it States \"In the United States they had to start over entirely taking whatever jobs they can find.\" This quote is releavant to my question because it shows that Narciso's family can make whatever they want out of their lives. That is the mood in the memoir \"@PERSON2 @CAPS1\" by Blueprints of Our Lives. The mood created by the author memoir is... LOVE and Sacrifice. He often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. As he was growing up in his environment instilled in him a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. He often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance, and he thanked them repeatedly. As he say \"he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house into a home\". The mood that was created by the author was respect. For example it told the boy that you don't have to be a blood realative. For instance, the author states \"@CAPS1 up in this environment in stilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative\". Another reason, was that you should always help your family s during bad times. For example the book reads \"Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporilily until they were able to get back on their feet\". Thirdly, the boy will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. For instance the auother quotes \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. The mood in this memoir I think would be happiness because his parents gave him happiness by being there all the homieness. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This show how much they've done for him and he has apreciated. Overall this is reconizing that family and happiness are unified. In the memoir, @PERSON1,\" by Narciso Rodriguez, has a very strong and touching mood.    In paragraph @NUM1 Rodriguez states \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This line describes the mood as extremely loving and touching because he is showing how much love he dedicates to his parents For the life he lived.     Also, in paragraph @NUM1 Rodriguez states \"... there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" This line also describes the mood as very calm and loving because he is extremely grateful for the life his parents gave him.    In paragraph seven, the last scentence really describes the mood because he is know showing the love to his parents and to his house where grew up, \"I will never forget how my parents turned thes simple house into a home\"     This memoir describes the mood as extremely loving and grateful. The mood created by the author is fairly formal, with a few informal parts. For example a formal paragraph, like paragraph number one, sets the stage of the whole memoir and uses formal transitions like \"After [living]\". Also, the paragraph is very informative, telling about his parents imigrating to the @ORGANIZATION1 from Cuba and how they were financially poor + could not afford a fancy home like they could in Cuba.An informal paragraph in the memoir is a paragraph like number six where he is describing how thankful he is for his parents being as selfless and giving as they are. He also uses informal transitions such as \"But, [in reality].\" And \"these...,\". It also just has an informal tone to that paragraph.As a conclusion these parts of the memoir have a good balance of formal + informal settings to keep the reader engaged. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" there was a mood to the memoir. The mood that was set was about how you should keep peace in the house. You should be grateful and appresitive to what your parents do for you and what they give you.Another mood that was set is to keep yoar house open to family and friends. And hope they would do the same for you. And no matter if your poor or have a small house \"family\" is always there. And family \"can turn a simple house into a home\" The memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" creates an overall mood of happiness, and some sadness at the same time. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains what it was like to live in his home in Cuba. The way he describes his experience in the kitchen cooking and listening to music gives the reader a warm feeling. It says, \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This sentence not only makes the reader happy for him, but they can see unity in his family. In paragraph @NUM2, he also shows how life with his family was. \"It was a close-knit community of hardworking immigrants...\" On the other hand, there's also a part of this story that makes the reader feel sad for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @NUM4, he explains the difficult life his parents had moving to @LOCATION1. \"They struggled both personally and financially\" it says in paragraph @NUM3. It's upsetting to read this after hearing of all the great times he had with his parents. That's why the end of the memoir and the beginning have two different moods. Both happiness and sadness are shown in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez.\" The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates in his memoir is a very good and bright. He and his parents survived hard times in their New Jersey home, such as segregation of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 like himself and not always having enough money. Yet he and his family survived because of the unity of his closely-knit community, Immigrants from @ORGANIZATION2, the @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4, and elsewhere all came together and ignored their differences. They shared food, shared their homes, and shared happiness between them. There was a certain trust among the community, every family holding their door open for anybody,\" knowing that they would do the same for [them].\" (paragraph @NUM1) To make the mood of this excerpt very light and cheerful, Rodriguez uses words like, \"rich culinary skills and love of cooking,\" (¶ @NUM2) \"innocence of childhood,\" (¶ @NUM2), \"hard working\", (¶ @NUM4), \"courage,\" and \"selflessly,\" (¶ @NUM5) \"grateful... love and sacrifice,\" \"admiration for their strength and perseverance,\" \"spirit of generosity.\" (¶ @NUM6). All of these words show that through solidarity, hope, and courage, people can make a good life for each other, no matter how hard their situation is at first. Based on the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the mood created by the author in the memoir could be described in many ways. To begin with, the boy is very so grateful for his parents and adore them so much. And paragraph two it states, \"the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)\" @CAPS1 more, his parents left the country Cuba to have a better life for there children. In paragraph five it says, \"they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carreers in the country they love.\" @CAPS2, he thanks them and admires their strenght and preserverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" As you can see, the mood of the memior created by the author could be described in many ways.  The mood created by the author (narciso Rodriguez) in the memoir was that he was grateful/appreciative for his life, and also happy with his life. Through out this memoir I think he has realized and is explaining what family really is and that he is grateful for having one. You'll figure this out when you read this because he states, \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being blood relative.\" what he also says that proves his mood was grateful is, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 with all this being said I believe thats what his mood was through out the memoir. From the reading \"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives\", by Narciso Rodriguez set a certain a mood throughout the whole entire reading. That mood is happy and friendly. They based their lives on family and happiness inside their home. He said that \"My parents always kept their arms and their doors open.\" this shows that if family or friends needed help they were there for them. It also stated people in your family don't have to be blood related and that many people where welcome to eat dinner with them. This shows how nice and how well the neighborhood got along. They would also surround themselves with Cuban food and music show that they where proud of who they were and that they made their new home a nice and piecefull environment. The aurther talks about home and family which would be a calm, caring, and happy mood. The author created these moods by talking about memories and how her parents moved from cuba to give there child a better life and how they take in family mebers in need until they get back on there feet. She said her parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Which is kinda like a happy mood and \" Here, the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Which is definatly a calm and happy mood. In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives the mood was very happy and made me thankful. My grandparents moved to the @CAPS2.S when my mom was just six. They wanted to give her and her brothers and sisters a better life. This is why I am thankful. I live in the @LOCATION1. The mood is also happy because everyone loved eachother. They didnt have the nicest home, but it was full of love. The music was always playing and Family came a lot. The door was always open in the Rodriguez house. The last sentence in this memoir \"I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This made me smile it was so beautiful. This is how the mood was happy and made me thankful. The next time I see my grand parents I will make shure to thank them for moving to the @CAPS2.S and giving are Family a better life. I beleive the mood that sets off in the beggining of the story is how in her house cuban music and great aroma's From @CAPS1's @CAPS2 through the air, I also think that it gives picture of laughter and happiness, And I think that throughout the story @CAPS3 tells that @CAPS3 relizes through spending time with community that his parents are teaching him, Just because someone isn't blood related dosent mean they can't be lik family as said in the package, There teaching him that It Is also people that love you and care about you. As @CAPS3 continues through the passage It says that his family is all ways open to take care of people that they love and need help. @CAPS3 soon relizes that all his family gave up from their old lives was so that they could provide a nice home for him and teach him a valuable lesson in Life the true meaning of family. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives it talks about this fashion designers life. One example is in paragraph @NUM1 page @NUM2 it talks about his backround Narciso states \"My parent, originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956...\" The paragraph goes on talking about his parents and their names. Nex it is paragraph @NUM3 page @NUM2. This sets the mood of him growing up in a new inviorment. For example he States \"Growing up in this new instilled in me a great \"Family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our nieborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a tim when overt racism was the norm of segregation prevailed in the United States.\" @CAPS1 is on page @NUM5 paragraph @NUM6. It shows the mood of how he loves his house. For example he says \"... I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many thing or I learned there about how to love.\" In conclusion this is how the mood creates the author. The author creates many moods in the story. While reading this story I felt happy, sometimes sad and overall it made me feel good.The mood that the author is trying to sel is happieness and unity. even though many cultures and ethnic backgrounds were in his neiborhood they all came together as one. Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still in america. The story makes me feel good because the author is trying to say that it is not the materialistic things that make you happy it is the family and freinds that surroud you every single day. I believe the was more of a \"thank you\" in the memoir and here a three reasons. I think Narciso Rodriguez is thanking his parents for making him have a good childhood. Like in the excerpt \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Another reason I think he's thanking his parents because he was praising them. In the excerpt \"I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" @CAPS1 Narciso is forever grateful to his parents. Like in the excerpt \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" These are the three ways the mood was more of a \"thank you\" kind of thing in the memoir. on paragraph @NUM1 in the article it say's \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" I think that the mood the auther is creating in the memoir is happyness because Narciso is very geatful to his parents. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The blue @CAPS1 of are lives it gives you alot of different moods. One mood it gave me was happiness, I got this mood because he said cuban music filled the air and cuban music is normalli happy. I know Cuban music filled the air from when it states \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air\" @CAPS2 @NUM1. Also I got the mood of welcomeness because his parents always let people In the house. I know his parents did this from when it states \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family\" @CAPS2 @NUM2. Lastly this gave me the mood of love. I got this feeling because his parents did hard jobs because they loved their kids. I know this from when it states \"They had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find\" @CAPS2 @NUM3. These are the moods the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The blue @CAPS1 of our lives. In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, Narciso really sets, a joyous, happy mood when @CAPS1 describes his home. @CAPS1 gives the reader a feeling of just how much @CAPS1 loved his home. @CAPS1 sets a mood of gratefulness as well, when @CAPS1 describes how much is parents sacrificed for him to grow up well. \"There is no way for me to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" @CAPS1 sets such an ecstatic mood, that the reader wants to be there, at his home. This is a mood that Narciso Rodriguez sets, and the way @CAPS1 shows the reader just how great his home really is. This passag has a very calm and happy mood. He is looking back on his childhood and the memories. He talked about the cheerful house, people and neighborhood. You could picture the house and smell the aromas. Narciso set a very nice setting and tone that the entire passage was lifted in energy. You could tell he was passionate about what she was writing. He showed a real admiration for his childhood and the people he shared it with. The way he felt about her childhood was potrayed beautifully in this piece and that really helped the reader get into the happiness and community like feel. Her gratefullness potrayed into the mood and made the entire piece fun to read. The mood in this memoir is caring and loving. Even though everyone in the neighborhood isnt blood related they are all still family. Everyone in the neighborhood is so welcoming, he tells us how his mother always leaves the door open for those who welcome her in. When they all have partys everyone is so happy to have what they have. Narciso is over greatfull for what a life his parents give him and he can never thank them enough. He says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house to a home.\" His parents are also very greatfull for how thankfull Narciso is.  Everyone in this \"family\" will forever love eachother The mood the author portrays is love and unity. The author portrays his love for his parents when he explains how selfless they were in immigrating to @LOCATION1, and sacrificing so much for the sake of their children. They also show unity by explaining how close everyone in his neighborhood and family are. They all share a similar culture, and they consider a lot of the people in their neighborhood family, even if they are not blood-relatives. A lot of their family lives close by, and they often spend time together, usually for meals as it says in paragraph @NUM1. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The blue prints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso explains the mood of his home. One way is in para graph @NUM1 when he says \"Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixed with the aromas of the Kitchen\". This @CAPS1 the mood of family. It gives you this sense of a warm family.Another way is in paragraph @NUM2. He says \"My parents always Kept their arms open to the many people we considered family\". This gives a loving and caring feeling. It also gives the sense of family.The last way Narciso explains the mood is in paragraph @NUM3. In this paragraph he just gives an overall warm and inviting mood. He says how appriciative of his parents he is. He really @CAPS1 the mood to be thank ful of everything they have done. These are a few ways Narciso @CAPS1 the mood of the memoir. The mood of this memoir is one of love and kindness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.\" This shows how close and kind the neighborhood around the house was. The end of paragraph @NUM2 it states \"Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. The way that her parents helped the community out shows their general love and kindness for all. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house were a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here that I learned the definition of \"family\". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" It says right out that the \"scent\", or mood, is of love and that this is where he learned how to love. The mood of this article is very loving and kind. In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a warm and loving mood. First, he talks about his welcoming house. Rodriguez writes, \"...the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both...\" (@NUM1) this shows that Narciso's home was open to anyone. Also, he talks about how close he was with others. Narciso writes, \"...\"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative\" (@NUM2). This explains that everyone near him was like family. Finally, his parents were able to support these bonds. He writes, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" (p. @NUM3). This shows that Narciso's parents had to go through a lot to make it all happen. Overall, Rodriguez creates a loving mood of togetherness. In this paragraph I'm going to tell you the mood created by the author in the memoir I just read. One mood that the author had was happy. The reason why I said that is because everytime he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice. Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't his a real grandparents until 1970. He sounded a little deppressed about that. I also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir. Those are the moods that I think the author created during the memoir. The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.\" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents, and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author. The mood in this memoir changes throughout the story. First off, the mood starts with being friendly. \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" This tells us everyone in the neighborhood is nice. In the middle of the story, the mood is strong and determined. \"They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters.\" This tells the people had to stay strong through hard times. Lastly, the end of the story is greatful. \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" This tells how the narrator is thankful. All in all, the moods in the story fit together nicely. The mood the author created in the memoir was happiness. He/she wasn't sad at all because all his/her memories were happy. His/her memories taught him/her what family was. The tone the author gave out was joy. \"Endless celebrations\" \"all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship\". Not one of his/her memories he/she talked about showed any sadness for he made a lifetimes of friends. The author showed us a calm and grateful mood for everything that have happened. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The author wanted to express a lot of gratitude for what his/her parents have done for him/her. Through his/her parents Narciso Rodriguez have so much happy memories. Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was anything but sad and his/her memories taught him/her family. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates a mood in the memior in many ways. For example, the author is in a loving mood of the begging of the memior. In paragraph two, he says \"...a love of cooking that is still with me today.\" In addition, the author is in a caring mood at the middle of the memior. In paragraph four, \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family\". Lastly, the author is in sed mood neer the end. In paragraph @NUM1, he says \"They struggled both personally and financially...\" In conclusion, the auther creates a mood in the memior in many ways. In this memoir, the mood is very light hearted and kind. It gives you a feeling of peace and community.Several times the author tries to show appreciation. Not for any one thing in particular, just gratitude. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he puts phrases in parentheses for no reason other than to show gratitude for his life as a child. As a result of this, while reading you get a feeling of peace and kindness.Because of his repeated display of gratitude, the mood is light hearted and unserious. The author creates a unique mood in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. The mood is loving/caring/kind from what the authors saying about his memories. It is loving because he is talking about all the close relationships he had with his family and friends. \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" The mood was also sad because throughout the whole thing he was saying thank-you to his parents for all his oper tunities. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Also another mood is happy, happy from all the great memories. He talks about all his family and friends hangin' out and having a great time. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a unique mood. The mood that the author created in the memoir is a very loving and caring one. This is because the author tells what his parents gave up just for him to have a good life. That means his parents really loved him because they wanted him to grow up and have a good life. And that was something that they could find in @LOCATION1. It is very caring of them because when they moved to @LOCATION1 not only did they look after their baby, but other people that needed help as well. To them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other. The mood is really both loving and caring because it shows how an group of people are so close, that they love and care for each other as one family. No matter what even in hard times one of them will always have their door open for them, and they can always relay on them. That is what family is about. The mood created by the author in the memior is very pleasant, proud and happy. He shows that in growing up in such a wonderful @CAPS1 @CAPS2 family and home that he felt that the experience he had in his home was just exceptional. He believed that by growing up in this enviroment instilled a great sense family had nothing to do with being a blood relitive. He was very grateful to his parents for his love and sacrifice and couldn't ask for anything more. By growing up in such a wonderful place he will always never forget how his parents turned his simple house into a home. In this memoir, the auther creats a mood. The mood that this author creates is the gratefulness. The reason that I say gratefulness is because Narciso Rodriguez is so greatful, and so happy to have two loving, caring, selfless parents. He's grateful to have not only a house, but a warm, cozy home, where he's grown up in and had so many memories. He is grateful to have all the perks of a traditional cuban home, with the food, the music, and all of the people Narciso is grateful that his Parents basically just gave up their own lives and dropped everything, so that he could have a better life. Nariso cannot imagine @CAPS1 to @LOCATION1 not knowing the language, not knowing anything, and leaving everything he knows behind. However that's what his parents did. they sacrificed so much for him. and he appreciates that more than anything. I think that the mood that the author chose for this story was perfect. The mood of this memoir is @CAPS1. I say this @CAPS2 his family always let people from the neighbor hood come over and they were like family. His parents let people stay with them \"until they got back on their feet.\" @CAPS3 admired his parents for their \"strength and perseverance\". Through everything they had been through. The mood set by the author is very solemn. He started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation. That was hard because he was Cuban. He didn't have a lot of money, and lived in an apartment. His life was like a somewhat below avereage life today.Towards the middle the memoir was still serious but happier in a sense. It was happier because we Know that he could have more life opportunities in @LOCATION1. He grew up and actually met people and made friends. Also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him. He made the memoir and nice and passionate.The moods started off a bit shaky and very serious. Then he got into a happier mood by telling how his parent and family were good to him. It ended in the same mood started in the middle of the passage, happy. The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a comfortable. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir it made me think of my own home life. And how important my family is to me. It also allowed to see how full and good his was to. I mean I love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells. Also, the wonderfull music that played and the people that always came over to visit. And all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another. That's the feeling I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir. In the memoir the mood is very loving, @CAPS1, and thankfull. The mood is loving in many different ways. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Also, \"it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" Also @CAPS1 is expressed throughout this memoir. \"It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refuges to celebrate their arrival to this country, and where I celebrated my first birthdays.\" @CAPS1 is expressed by the family gathering a the dinner table more times that not. The greatest mood in the memoir is how thankfull he is to his parents. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Also \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" In the memoir a @NUM1 year old man Narciso Rodriguez, Sr. good affored to move to the modest, three-room apartment soon called home. (@CAPS1 @NUM2) In 1961 he was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. @PERSON1, Sr. was a mood like man he was greatful, kind, traditional, and happy. Narciso was greatful because his parents passed a rich culinary skills and a love of cooking to him. He was happy because he could move to an affordable three-room apartment. @PERSON1 is traditional because he would listen to Cuban Music that would fill the air with mixing the aromas of the kitchen (@CAPS1 @NUM3), he would also have a Cuban feast which brought life and the love (@CAPS1 @NUM4). His babysitter was his first friend that lived above him and graced his kitchen with meals. This man's life was very successful because his traits would show about his community. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author explains the true meaning of family and home. The mood is extremely deep and pearsonal as he describes the love and selflessness his family expressed. He explains that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1 so that Narciso, their son, would have a better, successful life. Reading this memoir, I can picture Narciso getting very emotional expressing how grateful he is for his parents and family. He explains, \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home\" (@NUM1). This sentence and last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal. It went from happy, appreciation, and an explanation of his life to deep, incredibly personal, and to his complete thoughts. Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends like most people should be able to experience like Narciso writes about in his memoir. The mood created by the author was a very unique one. The author was remembering and charising the memorys he had of his old home. He described his home by saying how brave and courageous his parents were to give him a better life also how his family was so rich in culture and how his family and neighbors would always visit because times were tough but the authors parents never turned them down. The author made it sound that it was the perfect childhood and described it with such detail and passian and that is why the mood is so unique and special. The mood created by the author was warm, welcoming, and gratefulness. When the author described his home, it gave a feeling of warmth and it was very welcoming. He made me feel like I was invited to his home with open arms and I could feel the environment around me. He gave of a feeling of gratefulness when he explained how grateful he was to his parents for sacraficing everything and how much he appreciates everything they have done for him. He showed in the passage the warmth and love in his home. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a powerful mood for the reader. First, right of the bat I felt love and thoughtfulness, which I still felt throughout the story. \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" This made me think of my parents immediately. My father gave up his career and my mother gave up her family to give me and my brothers a better life. This feeling is without words. I can't describe the level of gratefulness I feel, just as Narciso does. Secondly, the admiration I shared with Narciso. She described her parents well enough to put me in her shoes. \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS1 thanked them repeatedly.\" What her parents did for her was incredible and something to learn from. From Narciso's story, I got a sense of admiration, greatfulness, and connection, which I believe are the moods she created throughout his story. The mood that the author created in this memoir was love and gratefullness. The author is trying to get their message across about how much a family is bonded together and how much there is to be thankful for. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This shows how much love the author has to be grateful for. He is also trying to say that there is no way to express his emotions and love to his parents. \"But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" The authors main point is to thank their parents for everything they have done. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, happiness, and self lessness. The of the memoir that emphasized the mood of love was when the author mentioned that, \"It was here where I learned the true defonition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" The mood for that exerpt was love because it explains how much he cared for his family and neighbors. There were many exerpts in this memoir that gave the mood selfless ness, As such, \"They came self lessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers, in the country they love.\" This indacates selflessness by explaining how they left behind their jobs, family, and friends, all to give their children what was best for them. The overall mood of the story was happy because it explained their happiness, struggle, courage, good outcome, and beloved memories. The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The mood was grateful because Narciso was glad his parents moved to the @LOCATION1 and started their wonderful home. Narciso was grateful of this because he grew up in an environment he loved.                                                                                                                                                     The mood created by the author is happy. The mood is happy because Narciso is happy that he grew up around people who loved him. This made him happy because he knew that he was safe and loved with these people. When his community of differences came together to form one community, this made Narciso happy. The mood is both grateful and happy. I would also be grateful for this, happiness is key to having friendships and famalies. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is set to reflect family values and memories. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she explains that her family is From Cuba and they raised her in a replica of a traditional Cuban home. She tells us that her parents bolth cook traditional Cuban foods and teach her how to cook as well. Then another example is from paragraph @NUM2 when she tells us that her family stays with her a lot, such as uncles aunts, cousins, grandparents, they @CAPS1 stay whith her until they are able to get on their feet again. Finaly in paragraph @NUM3, @NUM4 and @NUM5 It explains the sacrifice that her parents had to give in order to start a new life in the US, and about how her familly takes in other refuges and also about how she will never forget her parents and all the memories that go along with the house. The mood of this memoir is love and staying a family. The author sends a message to her readers when one leaves what they once had. Her tone tells the mood by writing with passion. The mood is basically is being happy with what you have. that's how the family written about acts in this memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir was ment to be a happy and thankful mood. The mood was created happy because the child Narciso was very hapy that his parents moved to @LOCATION1. He was also happy because his house was not just a house it was a home. The kin Narciso was thankful because his parents let other people into the home untill they have somewhere elese they can call home. He is also thankful that he got his parents marvilous culinary skills so he can cook very well. He is also thankful for his parents love and sacrifice. The mood that we are suppose to get is a happy yet calm mood well we read this because Their is nothing to exciting but their is some parts where you get happy for what they did and you feel calm because as I said their is nothing really jumping out at you.  it is just a life story. The mood the author created in the memoir was joyful and optimistic. In the memoir, the author describes his home and how even though the house wasn't much, his parents made it feel inviting and comfortable. In his neighborhood, all the people were friends and took care of each other when they needed help. The author's home reflected the Cuban culture because of his parents. The author describes the hardships his parents had to go through like adjusting to a colder climate in not getting good jobs. Even though they had their own troubles, they were selfless and didn't let their problems get to them. The author is very grateful for how his parents gave him a home and taught him what a family really was. The mood the @CAPS1 created was a mood of happiness and gratitude. The @CAPS1 States how he will always be grateful for what his parents did for him. He also stated that he admired them and honestly could never repay them for everything they did This shows how the @CAPS1 @CAPS4 how his parents worked so hard to make his life better. He is forever greatful. In the memoir, \"@PERSON1,\" by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The mood is set right from the beginning. The first thing said to Start the mood was, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful.)\" This shows the author is grateful and happy. The memoir also said, \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This shows how the author is very proud. Also lastly the memoir mentions, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This again saw how grateful the author is. In this passage the mood is set to be grateful, happy, and loving right from the start. The author creates a grateful mood. The author writes about how his parents had good jobs in Cuba but left everything to give their children better lives. He also writes about how he grew up, which is parents teaching him about music, cooking, and family. His parents never got the jobs they deserved because of the barriers to work for their children. The author is grateful for the things parents did for him so he could get a better life. The mood created by the author of the memior exposed various emotions and contrast. In paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author talks alot about culture, he explains how they could not live without having their practice, in their lives. \"Rich culinary Skills and the love of cooking (and for which I am internally grateful). Passionat Cuban music (which I adore to this day) ...\"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity\". Another mood the author captures is greatfullness. In paragraph six the author explains how he is so grateful for the strength and courage his parents showed from moving away from Cuba. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have done.\" The final way the author creates a mood is during the last sentence of the memoir. The author states \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\". This quote captures the mood of being thankful for the unity of his family. He looks up to his parents for making his life as great as it is today. These are some moods the author creates throughout the memoir. The author of this memoir presented a kind of grateful and cheerful mood. I believe it is this type of mood because in the memoir he talks so much about on how that he is so grateful that his parents were so caring and selfless people because they moved from their home country cuba just for the sake of their children. He presents the cheerful mood by focusing all the good things in his life with his parents in his house and neighborhood. Example's are him talking about how all the cultures got along good with one another in his area. He also talked about the good times he had with his parents in the kitchen. The memoir he left was definetly a pausitive one not a negative one. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood of this is full of love and happiness.When Narciso is talking about his mother and father he starts to talk about how they always loved and cared. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This shows that the whole house was filled with love because of Narciso's parents. Also,the way Narciso talks about his parents shows that he lovef his parents. This also showed happiness because since he would never forget his home in must've been nice there. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This shows that the house was full of happiness and warmth. This is because of all the friends, family, and celebration. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood of this is full of love and happiness. The mood created by the author is outstanding. The mood is nice, and warm-hearted. the author talks about how the heart of the home is in the kitchen; and how cuban music is always playing this sets a happy, cheerful mood. then, the author talks about how their home is always open and welcome to family and friends. this sets a warm, loving mood finally, the author talks about the cuban feasts and close relatives he has after reading the story, you feel like part of the family. Narciso creats a mood that shows family ties and unity within his community. By showing the way that each member of the community are willing to help each other gives a positive and freindly mood to the memoir. Also, he shows how members of the community treat each other as family regardless of race or ethnicity. This gives the the memoir a loving and accepting mood to it. The mood created by the author in the memoir is proud This is the mood because he is showing thanks to all of the things that he learned in his childhood that he is proud of. One example of this is when the author talks about his Cuban heritage and how he still loves Cuban music. He is also proud for his parents immagrating to the @LOCATION1 to start a better life for him. He is also proud because even though the other people that lived in the neighborhood with him were of different backgrounds everyone accepted eachother. Another reason he is proud is because his parents would help give so many people home to stay in. The author is most proud of his parents because of tier love and sacrifice. They were loving to all and they sacrificed a lot to get to where they were. The mood of the author in the memoir is that he is very proud in what his parents have done.  The mood of this memoir is relaxed, happiness and thankfulness. Narciso makes their home feel peaceful and realxed. \"a great sence that family had nothing to do with being blood realted.\" This shows that @CAPS1 is very happy with his household and his life that @CAPS1 shares with all of his \"family.\" @CAPS1 is very thankful for his parents for giving him a good life and for giving up theres in cuba do come to @LOCATION1 to help give him a better life. \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home. The mood of this memoir is almost remorseful, remembering his childhood home, his family life that includes his neighbors and extended family Narciso Rodriguez creates a feeling of being home and being surrounded by people you love. He explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him. And his real grandparents were still in Cuba so his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents. He also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the United States. They had to settle with getting jobs underequiped for their abilitie. His parents, he said \"came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give the children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved\". He feels that this is one of the reasons his childhood house was turned into a home. The mood that the author was trying to create was a sense of hope, family and happiness. Hope was @CAPS1 because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on there feet which provided hope for the extended family. Family was @CAPS1 be cause in the last paragraph he is explaining how in this tiny apartment you learned the definition of \"family\" through welcoming refugees and celebrating his first birthdays and having a loving, careing enviroment. Finally I think happiness was @CAPS1 because he was explaining how grateful he was for his parents coming to america to give him a better life and also in paragraph two he was explaining how his home environment was filled with cooking and music which can be factors of happiness. These are some moods that the author was trying to show. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" (who is also the author) is writing about his live changing experience. The mood of the poem is happy. His parents immagrated from Cuba to the United States in 1956. When he was growing up he learned all Cuban traditions and envied them all. He's very proud of his parents for the risk that they took for him. This is why the mood of the story is happy. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, several moods such as comfort, sympathy and a sense of family are created by the author. Immediately as I began to read I felt comforted by the author writing about the home and family. I felt especially warm inside when he talked of his fond memories with friends. As the author continues, you cannot help developing a sense of security. However, once you continue reading and get into @CAPS1 @NUM1, the mood darkens. The author talks about the hardship his parents had to endure to give him a better life. I solemnly read on and was filled with a sense of family. \"I'll always be grateful to my parents,\" the author writes. \"for their love and sacrifice.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). He explains how much he appreciates the love and care given to him by his family. While reading this memoir, I have felt comforted, sympathetic, and a strong sense of family, as I'm sure the author had too. The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez was calm and loving. @CAPS1 creates this mood by explaining a loving family, new friendships, and an overall welcoming feeling.To begin with, in paragraph Narciso Rodriguez states, \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This quote creates a calm loving mood because it explains that the author enjoyed his childhood, and loved if family who loved him back. @CAPS1 again complements his family and the way @CAPS1 was raised in the first sentence in paragraph @NUM1, also creating a common loving mood.Next, at the end of paragraph @NUM1 Narciso Rodriguez explains the love @CAPS1 feels towards his friends when @CAPS1 states, \"... All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" @CAPS1 again shows the love towards his friends in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3. Showing love towards his friends creates a calm loving mood.Lastly, the calm and loving mood was also created because of an overall welcoming feeling. In paragraph @NUM4, the author welcomes the reader into his past by speaking about his childhood home that @CAPS1 loved. Also in the last sentence in paragraph four @CAPS1 explains the people his parents help stating, \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" This quote explains welcoming people people creating the mood. Explaining a loving family, new friendships and an overall welcoming feeling create the calm and loving mood, created by the author. The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home The feeling in this article when it talks about family is love, peace, happiness, and gratefulness. Narciso understands that his parents left everything in Cuba for him. @CAPS1 could tell that his parents love him very much and @CAPS1 is grateful for that. In paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 states, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 has the opportunity to be born in @LOCATION1 and having a better life. Narciso also learned that @CAPS1 could love a non blood relative because they could be his family too. There were many people that were like family to him. @CAPS1 loved them and they were happy spending time with each other. In this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving. The mood  created by the author in the memoir shows a kind community, careful, and courage. My first quote is \"...hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.\"  The quote means the mood of the community is kind and helping. My second quote is \"My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family.\" This quote means that his parents  mood was careful and do anything for people if they needed help. My third and last quote is \"My mother and father had came to this country with such courage.\" This quote means like before they came to the United States they had courage and now they were going to make it and be successful.  Those are my three quotes and examples of the mood created by the auother in the memoir. the mood created by the author, I would say good. there very gratefull to there parents about everything. family is very important in the excerpt. In paragraph @NUM1, where it says \"Here, the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both\" is an explanation of how and why there so gratful towards there family. In paragraph @NUM2, where it says \"growing up in this great environment instilled me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" explains that being close to someone doesnt mean you your blood related. Nacisco was happy of what she had, even though she was poor. She loved her heritage which she still adore today. She is proud of being an cuban. She had good relations in her house. She had great neighbors. Her parents were hardworking and supported her. Her family had a good relationship with family and friends. She appreciated what her parents had done for her. They gave up their career and beloved country to move to @LOCATION1 for her to have a better life. Her friends and family, refugees came to her house all the time. Her baby sitter became her first friend. In @LOCATION1, they celebrated her first birthdays. These event would stay in her memory. She would never forget how her parents turned her house into a home, where she belongs. Her life will always be filled with music and love. So even though she had hard times, she still apreciated of what she had. The mood of the @CAPS1 of the text \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is very thankful and happy. I can tell this because in @CAPS2 @NUM1 it shows how greatful @CAPS3 was to live in that house with his parents. And in @NUM2 it says how much love Narciso had for his parents and how thankful @CAPS3 was. And finally in @NUM3 the @CAPS1 tells the reader how @CAPS3 was thankful for immegrants for giving their children a new begginning @CAPS4 are ways you can tell the mood of the @CAPS1 in the text The author created a mood of happiness and love. When Narciso Rodriguez was thinking back to the past he loved his home and his parents for what they did for him. The way, he lived was the mood of his house. It was free and welcoming. Just as the way his parents were to other immigrants. Narciso Rodriguez's cubian home was one of the most important things he cared about and grateful for. The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy mood. It is a happy mood because Narciso finally knew what family actually meant.For example when Narciso says \"It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays, It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.\" This quote shows the mood that Narciso had wich was happy.In conclusion Narciso had a happy mood because he finally knew the real definition of family. Throughout this @CAPS1 there is a very happy and loving vibe. This is shown in paragraph @NUM1, \"Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in a warm home. This paints a glorious picture of what @CAPS2 life in the house was like. Another example in the text is at the end, in paragraph @NUM2, \"I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home.\" This shows with happiness and love, It does not matter how rich you are, or what you own. Anything can be a home. The mood created by the author in this memoir is happy and loving. The author resortes to specific things she loves it remembers, such as her parents, family and friends. She also explains her past with such detail and care. When she explains the kitchen she talks about the music and the aromas and all the love of her parents. When she talked about he friends she mentioned Alegria her neghbor, baby sitter and first friend. The author talks about how her parents let friends and family in so often that it was a close-knit comunity and everyone cared and loved each other. In this memoir, there are many moods created by the author. One major mood in this memoir is love, and loving. In paragraph @NUM1, \"... the many things I learned there about how to love,\" and also, \"... not just scent and music but life and love.\" A second major mood in this memoir is warth. In paragraph @NUM1, \"it was in the warmth of the kitchen...\" And third, a major mood in this memoir is gratefullness and being grateful of what we have. In paragraph @NUM3, \"and for which I am externally grateful,\" and in paragraph @NUM4, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" These are just some examples of moods created by the author in this memoir. The mood created by the author in this memoir is lovable. Narciso Rodriguez said he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He said that what they did was a more courageous thing than he could have ever done. Also, the mood is grateful. In the memoir, it says that Narciso thanked his parents repeatedly for what they have done. He also states, \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close – knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants, who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.\" That shows that he is grateful to have friends and family. Also, the mood is caring. This is because he stated that her parents came sefflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their friends and jobs. The mood the @CAPS1 created in the memoir is a peaceful happy riminder. the @CAPS1 said how he remenber coming to @LOCATION1 to get a beter Life. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 alot @CAPS3 in @CAPS5 @NUM1 the @CAPS1 says \"Growing up in this enviroment istelled in me a great sense that \"Family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" The @CAPS1 says how glade he is that his parents help him out a lot. @CAPS3 he says in @CAPS5 @NUM2, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The @CAPS1 reminds us alot about how he started and how he is now. at the end he says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" (@CAPS5 @NUM3) I think the mood that is created by the author in this memoir is cheerful and welcoming. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, \"My parents always kept their arms and the door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" The author is explaining how their house was always open to anyone that ever needed, all wanted to come, which is a very welcoming feeling. In paragraph @NUM2 he says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The movie is creating when he is saying this is very cheerful because he is very happy and grateful for what his parents did for him, and by him showing that it makes the mood cheerful. In paragraph @NUM3 he says, \"they came selflessly, as any immigrants do, to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind the families, friends, and careers in the country they love.\" When he says this, you just get this nice, warm feeling because they gave up everything they loved just so that their kids could have a better life. This gives off a very happy and cheerful mood. In conclusion when the author talks about his family, and his life he gives off a very cheerful, and welcoming mood. In the memoir, the author creates a loving mood. I think he creates a loving mood as opposed to something else because of the way he describes and explains things. For example, when he is describing his parents cooking. \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,\". The phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes \"it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need\", \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,\". The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for  all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir. In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. In the memoir it states, \"My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table.\" That quote also shows togetherness within the family. That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. The memoir shows that, \"... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved.\" @CAPS2, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times. I think the mood the author is trying to give is thankful, and satisfied, and that he is loved. An example of his satisfaction is \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the to life in our home.\" And an example of his thankfulness is \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today...\" And lastely an example of him being loved is \"Growing up in this enviorment instilled me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" I can tell that Narciso feels all three of those feelings and he presents it well. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir. Is a very happy and grateful mood. It is happy because in paragraph @NUM1 it says \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, Formed the backdrop to life and are warm home. It is grateful because he says in paragraph @NUM2 \"They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it means leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. In paragraph @NUM3 it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. This is the mood created in this excerpt. Narciso Rodriguez sent a very loving and inviting mood to his memoir. He wrote about his great home and family. He showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong. Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him. The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. His home was a \"traditional Cuban home\". By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home\". Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories. In the memoir of \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez. The mood of the reading could be described as grateful. I can sense this mood by some of the things Narciso Rodriguez mentions. The author would constantly say \"thank you\" to his parents for all the sacarfies they had to mak for a suitable living enviroment for Narciso. It also states that \"there was no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" Over all, in the memoir of @PERSON1 the mood can be mainly described as Grateful towards his parents, heritage and home. @CAPS4 on the article Narciso Rodriguez\" by from Home: the @CAPS1 of Our Lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir is loving, happiness, and greatful. There are many @CAPS2 showing the mood @CAPS4 on the article. For @CAPS2 one of the moods created is shown in para @NUM1 \"gratefull.\" @CAPS2: \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS3 that he love them anyways even if it is good or bad. Another @CAPS2 of the mood grateful is in para six, is by him telling his parent he is grateful by @CAPS2 \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strenght and perseverance, and I thanked them repeatedly. @CAPS3 he does it with love, another mood in the article. Those are the moods created by the author in the memoir, @CAPS4 on the article \"Narciso Rodriguez by \"from Home: The @CAPS1 of Our Lives. \" The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a lot of his @CAPS3 in the story. The @CAPS1 creates a mood that makes you think about your self and your family. He talks about his family and when he was a boy and were he grew up. The @CAPS1 also spoke about his parents and there life. He also talkes about how he and his parents lived in a neighborhood with imigrints. The @CAPS1 talks about how it is hard for him and  his parents to leave without the rest of there family. The @CAPS1 also talkes about how he loves music and how he loves his parents as well. His parents helped him and gave him hope. He also uses music to simbolize his life. Now he is a successfull fashion designer. The mood created by the author in the memoir was mellow because he's talking about his life and his greatfuless to have been raised in @LOCATION1. Also the mood was happy, because he said \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" which is him talking about how his parents made @LOCATION1 feel like home. Those with the moods of the story The mood in the memoir represents friendship, family, helpfulness, one example of helpfulness is in the @NUM1 paragraph it says \"It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working, immigrints who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own Kind, were clearly in need.\" @CAPS1 good example of the mood in this memoir is family but also ties back to helping is in paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concider family. Knowing that they would do the same for us. This is what the memoir is about. The mood created by the author was a happy and exciting mood. This is because the family was so excited about moving to a new place with better oppertunities and educational purposes. It also changed a regular house into a special home for them because they had people over and over and over which finally became family. The neighbors also helped create the mood by not creating any negative action or violence in the author put the family's location in a non-american neighborhood. The mood of the memoir is kind and loving. It showed kindness in paragraph @NUM1, what the memoir described how his parents made the whole house feel sweet and nice. He did this by using words like \"innocence\", \"celebrations\", and \"warm home\" to create a the feel of kindness. Love was shown when the author told about the way his parents welcomed anyone of every race to live with them until they \"got back on their feet.\" This shows love because when you are welcomed no matter what the problem is or who you are, it deminstrates love to everyone. When you have a loving family and a beautiful home, you should be very grateful. Narciso Rodriguez was also very grateful. The overall mood of Narciso's story is gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez was born in 1961 in Newark, New Jersey. His memoir explains how @CAPS1 is grateful for everything. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 would always tell his parents about his admiration for their strength and perseverance. His family cared for everybody and \"Always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" All and All the memoir's mood is gratefulness because Narciso was very grateful for everything. All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the @CAPS1 in this  memoir. But the biggest feeling of all is love his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give @CAPS2 a better life, Even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, friends all behind just to give their son a better life. Also after they arrived they lived in a one room apartment for a year then moved to a new house and made it \"our traditional Cuban home\" so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso When he was born. Even after that they were still kind and had open arm for other immagrants. So I absolutly think that the @CAPS1 in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love. The ather creats mood in the memoir in soe ways. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author says, \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" His is an example because it is sayin That in some environments everyone is your family. In @NUM2 the author says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifices.\" This is an example because he appreciates everything that his parents did for him and he  always will too. That is how the author creates a mood The author showed his mood very clearly in the memoir. The way he worded things such as \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home\" Showed how happy he was toward his parents. He told us how greatful he was for his parents being so selfless and thinking about him first. He also makes it clear how he is proud and how he greatly respects his parents for the great things they did to improve his life. Also he shows how he admires his parents hard work and bravery for the things they have done. In conclusinon, His overal mood I think is his gratatude toward his parents. Narciso Rodriguez describes his life in the hardships and selflessness of his humble and caring parents. The moods created by this author is happy and lighthearted, inspired by his love, and gratefullness. Narciso views his parents as saviors, who sacrificed everything to provide a better life to their children. He is eternally grateful for their courageus acts that brought him incredible oppurtunities in @LOCATION1. He looks back happily at the warm and comfortable atmosphire of his home. He is greatful for his Cuban heritage that his family instilled in him at a young age. The unity of his close knit community taught him honesty, and the importance of hardwork.Narciso exudes love and a sense of pride in his incredible and hospitable family through his writing. Setting a mood a gratefulness a true admiration for parents who taught him important life lessons he will never forget. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy mood. The author's parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1 for their soon to be child. They did that so that he could have a better education and for that he is verry greatful. The author loved his home and had great times in their. It is his most favorite place in the whole world and that is why he talks about his home in great detail. The author had great family memories in the kitchen with Cuban music and the scent of Cuban food. The author's mood is gratefull. It is because for what his parents did for him by moving to Cuba. It also is happy because of all the great times he had there. The author would probably want to relive those times as I want to relive  times of my childhood. The mood created by the author is that he is remembering back at the old days how he used to live and how much he admires his family but mostly his parents. He came to the United states in 1956. In 1961, he was born into a simple house. The mood of the author is that he admires his parents to give their children a better life even though they left families, friends, and Careers in the country they loved just for their children. The author will always be grateful to their parents for their love and sacrifice \"I've thanked them repeatedly. Therefore this is the mood that the author shows mostly love for his parents family, friends and Cuba. He thanks and learns from his both parents for all they did to go on with their children no matter what they had to sacrifice for them The author's mood that is created in the memoir is love and gratitude. The author expresses how thankful he is of his parents to live and grow up in the home they made for him. He says that he knows that family is not just blood related. He tells how his parents had open arms and doors to people in the community who needed help. Their home was filled with @CAPS1 music, food and love. They would have celebrations of his birthday's and people's arrival to the new country. There was this atmosphere of love and thankfulness in his life and that is expressed in this memoir. The mood created by the author is that @PERSON1 is grateful For what he has. @PERSON1 is grateful for his parents arriving In @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 likes to cook Cuban food and listen to Cuban music. The mood I think also that @PERSON1 is most grateful to his parents for being brave for coming to @LOCATION1, and hes grate ful for his parents love and sacrifise. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 siys he will never forget how his parents turned a simpe house into a home The mood created by the author in this memoir would be grateful and happy. It really makes you wanna think about life and how good it is, thanks to parents and grandparent, even anchestors. It makes you want to love your parents even more seeing how they went through alot and probably gave up alot for you. Like leaving their homeland or giving up great things like @ORGANIZATION1 and Narciso Rodriguez Sr did for their family or son. They wanted a better life and education for their kids. They had to leave their homeland, where they were born and raised and give up some things to get better things. They had to give up their job and skill's they already knew how to do for better things. The good thing that happened or that they get is more freedom and better life and education, it's not easy leaving everything you love and where you are born but has to be done for better things and opportunities. Reading this memoir gives you or leaves you with a satisfying, grateful, happy and kinda sad mood. The mood created in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez is comforting. \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the Kitchen.\" @CAPS1 a sense of home, spending time with the ones you love. Is it not comforting? In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is happy and warm. This is because of the strong and caring relationships talked about in the memoir. As stated \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 the story that is what is talked about. In the story he talks about being aroud \"family\" people who arent blood realative; just that can make a person happier @CAPS2 the memoir make the reader happier because the author is writing about happy memories he'll never forget. Although it was simple the author put a lot of deep emotions that were portrayed in the story, which made the story has a deeper mood. The mood created by the author in the memoir was loving, caring, and heartwarming. The memoir had a loving mood because the author talks about friends and family and how important loved ones are. In the selection it said \", the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our home.\" Also, the author creates a caring mood throughout the story, from him to his parents. For example, \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open.\" and \"I will always be grateful to my parents,\". The author also creates a heartwarming mood in the memoir when he said, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" These are the few moods created by the author in the memoir. The mood in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, is comfort. In chapter @NUM1 it talks about the overall feelings of love and care that surrounded the Rodriguez household like a comfy blanket. Also, it talks about how the \"... congregration of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both...\" helped pave the road for a great childhood with many friends and family members who where always there for Narciso Rodriguez to rely on. Another example of the comfort within the Rodriguez home is that the \"... parents always kept their arms and door open to many of the people... considered family, knowing that they would do the same...\" This portrays an overall image of a community where everyone got along and helped each other out. Last but not least Narciso's home was \"...always filled... (with) life and love.\" Where he felt secure and cared for. All in all, the household that @PERSON2 lived in was a household filled with love, care and especially comfort that every child should have. This excerpt called \"Narciso Rodriguez\" written by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a light, happy mood. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1, where Rodriguez states \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family\". When he says this, it gives the reader a good feel of how his parents cared for anyone who needed their help. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" When he says this, it is another time he is telling us he is grateful for his family. Throughout the whole excerpt, Rodriguez lists many times he was happy and grateful for everything his parents have done for him, which sets a positive mood. There are many ways the mood was created by the author in the memoir. One way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the author's past memories. An example of this was \"passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air.\" This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because culture music came from the author's memories, which is the mood. Another way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the author's opinions of the memories. An example of this was in paragraph @NUM1 \"(and for which I am eternally grateful).\" This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because the author expressed their opinions in there own way which set the mood. In the excerpt \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, shows an specific mood. The mood from this is happieness and satisfaction. The family is happy because they got a new home, they have a child, and they made pretty good friends from the nabiorhood. The satisfaction part is in there too when they are satisfiyed with what they got like, a job, a home, family, friends, and they are makeing money. After all moods depend on your surroundings, like the people not the merchendise. And thats all that matters. The mood in This memoir is @CAPS1. Narciso Rodriguez is from a Cuban born and raised childhood he values everything they ever did for him.As stated in @CAPS2 @NUM1 of this passage he \"is eternally @CAPS3 for all that his family done wheather it was The @CAPS4 Cuban food they cooked him or weather it was the Cuban music They made him listen to. Growing up in a multiracial community made him accustomed to being a non segregated individual. The mood he sets when narrating this is @CAPS1 because, not once did he ever take life for granted.\"I will always be greatfull for what my parents showed within love and sacrifice, @CAPS6 ofen told them for what they have done was more couragoas Than i could have ever reached\". the mood created by the author in the memoir is how he was living with his family in the house.     the specific revelant in the story is said \"the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friend and endless celebration,\". and what he want to show how he was living with many people and he is a immigrate The mood created in the memoir is thoughtful and caring. \"I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. Narciso is very thankful and feels very much beloved in his family. In the mood in this memoir is not just thoughtful or kind or caring, it's the feeling loved and loving that feeling. \"It was here where I learned the real definition of family.\" In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood he created is gratitude. First, he is grateful to his family. For example he says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" (@NUM1). From this, you can understand how much he appreciates what his parents have given him.Next, Narciso is grateful for being part of such a caring family. He says \"there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age\" (@NUM1). This quote explains how much his family taught him about being kind.Finally, is grateful to know such wonderful people. Narciso says, \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbors, or the many things I learned there about how to love' (@NUM3). To sum it all up, the mood Narciso Rodriguez created for his memoir is gratitude. The mood created by the author in this... memoir would be thankfulness and appreciation. I think @PERSON1, wrote this memoir for his parents. He wanted to portrey that even though most people would think that he had a tough life, he would completely disagree. He reailzes that his parents did what they did so @PERSON1 would have a better life. He appreciated the fact that his parents always made anyone feel like they were part of the family. They were loving, caring, heartwarming people. Like @PERSON1 said, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\", the mood is very grateful. All throughout the story, the other kept stating that he is extremely grateful to his parents for their selflessness and care. This mood shows most in paragraph @NUM1 because he continually thanks his parents for moving to the United States from Cuba to help him when he is born. He thanks them for leaving their friends, family and jobs to help him, even if the new jobs they get are not what they deserve.So, as you can see, the author is very grateful to his parents, making this the mood. I think that the mood created by the speaker is gratitude. I think this @CAPS1 his parents \"unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)\" This shows that he appreciates his parents passing on their cooking skills. Another example when Narciso is thankful \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 they gave up their jobs of working in a laboratory and chemical engineering to make his life better. This shows that the speaker was creating a tone of gratefulness In the memoir in \"@PERSON1 Rodriguez\" by @PERSON1, the overall mood of the storie is happy.The reason its happy is if you hear the tone how shes telling us. \"I was born into a simple house situated in a two-family, blonde brinck building in the *** section of Newark, New jersy. My young parents created our traditional Cuban home.\" @CAPS1 sounds happy to be Cuban it what @CAPS1 is. thats what the mood of the memoir.Another reason it's happy is \"I learned the real defenition of family And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood. @CAPS1 cares about his familey @CAPS1 now feel what his parents showed him thats why the overall mood is happy.In the memoir \"@PERSON1 Rodriguez\" by @PERSON1 the overall mood of the memoir is happy. The mood created by the author in the memoir feels like that of simplicity and home. He talks of the music and smells of his house, giving the feel that one is actually there sensing everything. He describes his home in such a relaxed way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also good to eachother. It gives the empression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is right. He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and being a child I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser paying work. Sacrifices like those make me feel as if there is pure love left in the world, I only wish my parents cared like that. Though this story proves the love of two parents to their children, and that alone makes me feel a sense of peaceful closure. In the article Narciso Rodriguez the tone is loving, peaceful and happy. In this memoir it talks about family and friend coming together as one. In the article the best example of happiness and peace is the last sentence, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This shows joy because they are all together. Another example is in paragraph seven where he says I learned the real definition of family.\" This is loving because it shows he is happy and he enjoys being with friends and family. Another reason why the tone is grateful is because he says \"... there is no way I can express my gratitude...\" this is happy because he is thankful for what everyone does in conclusion the tone is happy, loving and grateful I think the memoir is a thankful and grateful mood. The author is grateful that she has parents that moved to @LOCATION1 for her. Also she is grateful that the simple place she lives in feels like a home. This says so in the last sentence \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" Also Narciso is thankful in paragraph @NUM1 \"my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly as many imagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved.\" @CAPS1 how thankfull Narciso seems to her parents who sacrificed their whole life for her. If that was me writing that story I would make the mood very grateful towards my parents. The mood of the memoir I believe to be grateful or enspioring. Narciso's parents are imigrants from Cuba who live in a rasict community and are working to be able to support there kids. They are great parents to Narciso and provide him with basic nacessidies. They feed him, and buy him clothes. Narciso is very kind and thankful for the trouble his mother and father go through and he is also very considerate to try to help them when they need it. The mood is grateful because that is how Narciso feels toworrds his parents. Throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's @CAPS1. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes \"But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me.\" @CAPS2 reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set! The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, talks a lot about home and how you can find family were your not expecting too.He sets the mood in the memoir, that portrays love, warmth, and happyness. The overall mood of the memoir is loveing. Like how Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1, \"And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about love.\"When Narciso was growing up he learned that \"... Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" All the cultures in his neighborhood came together in unity and Friendship. So Narciso Rodriguez wants to create a warm, loving, @CAPS1 mood to his memoir, just like he experienced growing up! The mood created by the author in this memoir is greatfulness. The memoir showed how greatful Narciso's was to his parents. Their bravery and selflessness must have truley impacted his life then and probaly how he lives today. It also give the feeling of respect. In this memoir it shows how much he truley respected his parents and community. And last I think it gives the mood of admiration. The memoir really expressed how much he admired his parents and community. It showed how much he admired his parents bravery and he admired his overcoming of odds. He also admired how a community of different races could get over that and pull toghether to really make a community.Those are some of the moods that ar expressed in this memoir. The mood created by the author in this memoir is generosity. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, talks about how much generosity his parents had. He says, \"My parents always kept their arm and their doors open to the many people we considered family.\" \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved.\" In the memoir Narciso says that he will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. His dad worked in a laboratory in Cuba and his mom had studied chemical engineering in Cuba. In the @CAPS1.S they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. He says that this house was where I learned the real definition of family. He also says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 parents were generous, grateful, brave and had courage. We should all be grateful for what aour parents sacrifice for us or had sacrificed. The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And Narciso's case his parents \"moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love.\" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area \"home\". By showing the selflessness of his parents the author is able to create a connection to a time in the readers life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them creating a perfect mood to enjoy the reading. The author's mood in this memoir is gratefulness, happiness, and gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1, the author shows happiness, \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" As you can see the author was very happy to move to @LOCATION1 to start a new, fulfilled life. In paragraph @NUM2, the author shows gratitude towards his willing parents. \"They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life...\" here the author shows that he's extremely grateful for what his parents did to help him make  a new life. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, the author tells direct explanation to why he's grateful. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1, the author in this memoir shows an extreme amount of gratitude, happiness, and gratefulness, to his sacrificing parents In this memoir there is a mood created by the author. In the memoir the mood is like, calm and happy and relaxing. In the memoir the author is saying \"passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" That was the mood of relaxing because when you hear music it relaxes you and when you smell something out of the kitchen that you like it relaxes you even more. Also in the memoir it says most of the people in the neighborhood was spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants which were honest, hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people. That was showing the calmness because if you know everyone of your neighbors are the same you dont have anything to worry about. The last mood is being happy thing that showed that is he was grateful for his parents. In the memoir the author says he is grateful fo his parents love, sacrifice, and courageous. An their admiration for their strength and perseverance. That was the mood created by the author in this memoir. In the excerpt, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Narciso Rodriguez's Home: The @CAPS1 print of our Lives, the author creates a very warm, kind of theme by painting a picture in the reader's mind of a family long ago, that lived in unity and supported each other, pulling through in the very end. The author mentions several things from which one can infer the sensation of a strong supportive family that has everything it needs. As the author tells us, \"In 1961… @NUM1 – family, blond – brick building… created our traditional Cuban home… very heart… kitchen… rich culinary skills and a love of cooking… Passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen… innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends… endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\" (¶ @NUM1). This quote comes across with not just @CAPS2 meaning, but with a feeling that's hard to obtain – like when you're sitting around a campfire with friends and/or family. This feeling is created by the author's language, displaying a masterpiece to the reader. Language like \"very heart\" and \"warm house\" is what really conveys it. In conclusion, the author uses language appealing to a readers sense of safety, warmth, and unity to create a warm theme in his memoir. The mood created by the author in this memoir is happiness. According to the last sentence were @PERSON1 says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. This means that the mood is very happy and that this mood is great. @PERSON1 has many memories of the home that are positive and he also learned from what his parents taugh him. This mood in this memoir is a very positive and happy mood because the passage is about good memories and bonds between friends and family. Such as, when they first moved from cuba to the unided states to start their lifes new. In the nonfiction memoir Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1, the author creates a curious and warm mood by talking about his origin, talking about his upbringing, and talking about his memories. First of all, the author talks about the Cuban family he was raised into in Newark, @LOCATION2. He tells the reader that he lived in a two-family home with Cuban immigrants. The author's origin makes the reader curious because they want to know more about the author. Also, the author talks about his life in an immigrant community and how he was exposed Cuban music, foods, and culture from his parents. The author's upbringing makes the reader curious and warm because they want to know more and learning about cultures and celebrations gives the reader a warm feeling. Last but not least, the author talks about his loving parents and Cuban feasts. The author's memories make the reader feel warm because love is heartwarming. As you can see, the author creates a curious and warm mood. The mood created by @ORGANIZATION1 in the memoir was a peaceful, loving mood. Narciso says that his @NUM1 room home usually had someon staying there temporarily until they could get back on their feet. In Narciso's neighborhood despite customs, all cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. The mood in the memoir was that the author was grateful. He was grateful for many things like love for  cooking and grateful for his parents. He is happy he has this family and he is happy that he has the simple house he was born in. There are a few choices the mood could be The one that the author has written about is happiness. He grew up where he had friends or family to have someone that they trust. He also had his land lord and first friend that helped grace their kitchen table for meals. His parents opened the door for family members, knowing that others would do the same. He thinks his parents are brave that they would have  courage to come to @LOCATION1, knowing that they would leave everything behind. He is most happy about how he learned about the real meaning of \"family\". Home is where the heart is, and nothing says that more than in the memoir Home: The Blueprints of My life. In the memoir, it talks about family and that where ever your heart is, is where your home is. The memior and gives a tingling and loving mood. It makes us feel happy and feel loving, especially in a few sections.First, when the author talked about what his familly did at home, it made theworld slow down and think about the family. Narcisoc (the author and narrator) said in paragraph two, \"endless celebrations and that encompassed both, formed the back drop to our life in our warm home\". This made a picture of a happy and laughing family like in the movies about the holidays.Second, Narciso said how united they all were. This painted a mood of unity and care. In paragraph four @PERSON1 recalled, \"My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us\". The makes the reader think of friendship and hope in trouble times.The mood that came was loving and that tingling feeling of hope. Most people can't find that feeling anymore, especially in these tough times. What most people do know is that and home is not a building, it's a santurary. The mood of the author i think is caring; but then I also think it's calm. I think it is caring because of the way he talks about the neighbor-hood. I also think it's caring because he understood what was going on. But I think it is calm because the way the way that he speaks it's in a calm tone. The author creates a peaceful mood in the memoir. Its peaceful because you can just picture the admiration in his voice when he talks about his family. One reason he loves his family is because, \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same.\" This means that their family always watched out for one another and protected everyone when they needed help. Another reason he loves his family, his parents specifically, is because they did so much for the author. \"They came selflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.\" This means that even though everything they have known is in Cuba, they wanted their children to have better lives and chances to be happy, so they left everything and moved on. These are some examples as to why the author has set a peaceful mood in the memoir. In the excerpt, the author creates a loving mood. It mentions that Narciso will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrafice. That's telling us they get along well and really care for eachother. And then there is his siblings that live in different parts of the apartment. They help set the table and eat with them so I can tell they are all really loving and caring and all enjoy being a family together. This why I believe the author is creating a loving, and peaceful mood. In  \"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 the author creates a mood. I think this is the mood of exceptance. @PERSON2 talks about how he grew up in a neighborhood with many other immigrants. Paragraph @NUM1 says \"It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees celebrate their arrival to this country\"... This shows that no matter how diverse people were. the author's family always accepted them and their differences. Paragraph @NUM2 says \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, and knowing they would do the same for us.\" This is another example of how loves and accepting the home that Rodriguez grew up in. It also shows how close, kind, and loving this community was in \"@PERSON2\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1. In the passage \"Narciso Rodriguez from home: the blueprints of our lives,\" written by Narciso Rodriguez @CAPS1 ponders, and re-memmorates past events about his parents home in Newark, New Jersey. The author creates a suttle, but happy memory in the passage.                                                                                                                            The first reason to why the mood is a suttle, but happy one would be because their are serious parts of the passage, and happy parts of the passage. In paragraph four Narciso recalls having a lot of his family members living near his familys his house. When @CAPS1 says, \"Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regulary joined us at our table.\" @CAPS1 refers to the supper table when @CAPS1 says, \"our table.\" The mood gets suttle when @CAPS2 talks about being greatfull to his parents for coming to @CAPS3 as immigrants with no working knoledge of @CAPS4 language, or writing. @CAPS1 also says in paragraph five, \"to give their children a better life.\" @CAPS5 these are many terrific details to explain the mood that Narciso is trying to put into this passage. I think the mood that this author is creating is love, happiness, and respect. He really admired and cared for his parents. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author remembers, \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" @CAPS2 of the mood is that they took their cuban styles and culture, and brought it to @LOCATION1, living in a simple house. Determination also plays a big @CAPS2. The author's parents were determined to have their kid have a better life. Mood is the overall @CAPS3 in the story, so I think it would be a mixture of happiness, unity, caring, and determination. The mood the author creates inthe memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso @CAPS1 from Home: The BluePrints Of Our Lives, is @CAPS2 but happy and loving at the same time. Narciso creates a @CAPS2 mood because he explains about his familys troubles and his friends and local neighbors. Narcisco explains what they went through, Which makes a person feel @CAPS4. Narciso also creates a happy and loving mood because he would say, People came from all over \"Made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants\" would come to this one city, they would unite and help one another. They would also consider each other one big family, which consists of happy and loving. Those are the moods the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates in the memoir. The mood created by the author in this memoir was really grateful and that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it shows how grateful he his about his family because in paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" This shows that he is really happy and grateful for what he has and that he actually realizes how many sacrifices they did for him and how much they love him The author gave a @CAPS1 and cultural mood to the memoir. He talks about the music and food of his childhood but he also talks about his Extended \"family\" and how they always had someone staying in the house until they could get back on their feet. He also talks about how the House dosn't make a home- its the people that do. If no one lived in a House it could never be called a home. The family and friends @CAPS2 bring it closer and closer to being a Home. In this memoir Narciso talks about his life. As @CAPS1 talk @CAPS1 always creates a @NUM1 creates a mood by talking about his environment. In paragraph @NUM2 it say, \"that \"family\" had nothing to do with being blood relative.\" @CAPS1 created a good mood cause @CAPS1 knows @CAPS1 has a lot of friends.Secondly, Narciso creates a mood talking about his first friend. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, Alegria lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not. Good mood for having a friend thats so @NUM4 creates a mood talking about his parents. In paragraph @NUM5 it says, \"My mother and fathe had come here with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. @CAPS1's in a good mood because his parents had alot of courage.Clearly Narciso creates a mood in the memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was happy. One way is \"My mother and fathe had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. they came selflessly, and many imigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind ther families, friend and carrers in the country they loved\". For example he was @CAPS1 of what his Parents did by coming to @CAPS2 with such carange. Second way is \"I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice\". For example you always thanks your parent when they do something for you. The is how the author describes his mood. There are many ways to describe the mood of the author in this memoir. I think the overall feeling and mood in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness. Narciso Rodriguez's parent were from Cuba and they werent very wealthy. Narciso grew up in a three room apart ment in a niehgborhood filled with immigrants from Cuba, @LOCATION1, and @LOCATION2. Narciso had great parents according to the memoir it says in paragraph seven, last sentence \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 means that @CAPS1 didn't care about the amount of space they had in the apartment @CAPS1 just cared and love the amount of love and the relationship they all had eachother. The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and how he wrote his feelings of being cuban. For example she was saying that she will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home. The author feel really happy of being cuban and celebrating her cultures in the United @ORGANIZATION1. The mood created by @PERSON1 in the memoir from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of generosity and friendship. From an early age, @PERSON1 recounts how more often than not there would be a guest at his table. It could be Alegria his \"babysitter and first friend,\" his surrogate grandparents, or any number of friend and relatives. There was a constant \"congregation of Friends and family\" they generously hosted, because his Family knew that because of their generosity, they would always be welcome at other people's houses. \"My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" This constant congregation of Friends and family in @PERSON1's home, creates a mood of generosity and friendship throughout the memoir. It was a very high up, cheerful mood. It made me feel as if I was there. In paragraph @NUM1 it said \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\". That means he thanks his parents for all the hard work they did. The @CAPS1 they made. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it said \"my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the Culture\". He is proud of his parents on coming from their country and speaking a different language and learning a new one is hard. All in all it was a very high up, cheerfull mood. The author creates a lively mood in which he is grateful for his parents love. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" They passed on their rich culinary skills and love for cooking in which he is eternally grateful. He adores to this day, the passionate Cuban music that filled the air. The author created a lively mood filled with love and gratefulness for his parents. The mood to me was love and to getherness. Every one in the community would help each other one out. In the passage they said \"It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not neciraraly not there own kind, were clearly in need.\" That tells me they will help and love anyone and any race like they were part of there own family. That is the mood this story portraise to me. The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and apriciative. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing they would do the same for us.\" This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez felt very grateful about where he live with all his family and friends, because he knows that if his family need something, their neighbors will alway be there for him and his family. Also in @CAPS1 @NUM2 it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez felt very grateful to have a family that was loving and thoughful towards him, through thoes tough times for him and his family. The mood created by the author In the memoir is a good mood  @CAPS1 knows that her parents moved from Cuba for her, to give her a better life. \"My young parents created our traditional Cuban home.\" There trying to give her the life they would have had in Cuba, only better. And @CAPS1 had unselfish family because they moved for her and let her grow up in a good community. And when they say \"All these cultures came together in great solidarity it just makes you feel good that segrigation stoped and people can hang out with others, from different places. Family is always first no matter what even if you dont understand, its always first which is why @CAPS1 creating a happy and good mood in the people reading this because of family. The mood the author created in the memoir was very happy and thankful. He grew up in a traditional Cuban home where his parents cooked and he was able to get a great sense of \"family\". Not just blood relatives but everyone who would do the same as them. There was no racism within their neighborhood. They all came togather Many people, and the for dinner everynight. His parents loved him and sacrificed a lot for him. His simple house was a home. These things created the happy and thankful mood The mood created by the author in the memoir was thankful @CAPS1 and happyness. He was so greatful for his parents, and how they gave up their whole lives in cuba just to come to america for there kids benefit. They had a good life in cuba, they had good paying jobs, and they had a nice home, and a nice huge family there and i bet they didn't want to leave. but it was something they had to do for their kids benefits. So they moved to america, and they left their home and their good paying jobs, and they also most importantly left their family. that im sure they are going to miss like crazy. In this passage he (the author) was the most thankfull boy ever, and he was thankfull for his parents sacrifice and how they came to this country with such courage and NO knowlage of the language of the culture. but they came to give their children a better life even if it ment leaving behind their family, friends, and carreers in the country. The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of love, kindness, and welcome. This is true because the author uses adjectives such as passionate, warm, humble, and simple to describe how the family lives surrounded by kind people with a loving ambience. Also, the author describes how his family always welcomed others into their home and received a similar kindness back. This, @CAPS1 describes, is because they consider everyone as family, which, as Narciso believes, is because of their love for each other. finally, the author explains how @CAPS1 is extremely grateful to his parents \"for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 states that @CAPS1 \"thanked them repeatedly.\" This also shows how Narciso wrote his memoirs to be full of love, especially for his parents, which dictated the mood of the piece. The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez is a loving and scaring one. Through out the memoir Narciso talked about how his whole neighborhood \"came together.\" Also, he gave the readers a feeling of how loving and caring his household was. Narciso also says \"growing up in this enviroment instilled in me great sense that family had nothing to with being a blood relative.\" @CAPS2 that his neighbors where close to him there where basically family. The @CAPS1 described in the @CAPS3 is loving and caring. The mood of the story is comfort. When the author describe his home and how everyone was welcome it made me feel as if those people were in a comfortable, safe, and loving enviornment. When you turn a house into a home you feel comfortable in it because you have many comforting and loving memories in it. The author said that many people came to his house to eat Cuban food. the mood that the author created is happiness. I know because he explains how much he is grateful for his parents, @CAPS1 happy he had a great home and he learned the real definition of family.The auther is grateful for @CAPS1 parents for the love they gave him. He says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.He is happy to have a place called home. And he wont forget it either. He also says. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.And last he learned the defintion for family. The article says \"It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\". The moods created by the author in the memoir are loving, care, family, sacrafice, and warmth. All of these moods are demonstrated when the author describes all of what her interpretation of family is, and when she described everything her parents have done for her. The passage that states: \"they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\", @CAPS1 that the parents sacrificed so much, and cared and loved their children so much that they were willing to give up their lives in their country and leave behind everything in order to make Narciso's life better. Their family provided warmth and care for everyone who needed it. They truly learned the real meaning of family. The author created a very loving mood in this memoir. The created by created by the author in the memoir is happyness because his happy cause he grow up in @LOCATION1 and for the courage of his family. Also love because he said \"I will never forget that house or it gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.' @CAPS1 admiration \"For their strength and perseverance.\" The mood created by the author in this memoir is that be proud and happy of who you are no matter what. One example of this mood being showned in the excerpt is when the family moves into the new apartment. The narrator says that \"My young parents created the traditional Cuban home. Passionate @CAPS1 music filled the air. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\" This shows the families proudenest of being cuban because even though they are in @LOCATION1 now, they didn't forget their cuban traditional of life, food and music. They are happy with their life. You should always be proud of who and what you are as explained in this excerpt.  The mood created by the author in the memoir is a loving mood. In the memoir, the author talks a lot about family. And even though they weren't blood related, he considered many people his family. In the text it says \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great Solidarity and Friendship. It was a close-knit community....\" @CAPS1 example of the mood being loving is the author talks about his parents being selfless and leaving so much behind. And they did all that just to make sure he got a better life. In the memoir it says \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" Also, the mood is loving because the author talks about how grateful he is. He's grateful to how much his parents did so much for him and others. In the story it says \"I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home.\" @CAPS2 are ways that explain why this memoirs mood is a loving mood. In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he undoubtedly creates a mood of happyness and love, love for his family and friends. His definition of family is different from other people's definitions, but many people would agree with his definition. He calls family not only blood relatives, but the love and friendship that people have for eachother. By creating a mood of love and happyness draws the reader into a cultural story and how his life was affected by that of his parents, and his family. When he describes the food, the laughter, the neighbors, the kitchen, and the house, it all feels very warm and feels like a place someone would love to be at. Because he talks about things people want to hear, he accomplishes a great feeling of warmth and being happy throughout the reading. The author of the memoir created the mood very well. The mood in the memoir was very warm and happy. There were many ways the author created the mood. One way he created it was by saying that at that time, overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. And then he said his neighborhood was made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants and despite the different customs all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.Another way the author created the mood was by telling us how caring his parents were. He does this when he tells us about how when ever someone was in need, they would let them stay at their house.'\"The next way the author creates the mood is when he says my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us.Those are some ways the author created the mood in the story. The author creates a mood in this memoir. The author starts off with a mood that is kind of sad. He explains how his parents lived in a one-room apartment when they moved from Cuba to the United States and that there was a lot of segregation going on in the United States. The memoir gets happier as the author describes in paragraph @NUM1 how friendly and close the people living around him were. The hardships of the author's parents are listed in paragraph @NUM2. The fact that they had to start all over again is sadening. The author finishes of in paragraph @NUM3 and @NUM4 with a happy ending. He describes what he has learned from his parents and everything he is grateful for. For example, he learned the true meaning of \"family\". The mood that the author creates is very important to the memoir. In the memoir the author created the mood of being happy and joyfull. One reason I feel this way is by the way he talks about what goes on in his home. Like when he talks about the hart of the home being the kitchen and how his parents passed on the skills and a love for cooking to him in paragraph @NUM1. Another reason I feel this way is the way he describes the types of friendships he has with is neighborhood. Like in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about how all of the different cultures come together and have great friendships with each other. As I read this it makes me think of all the fun and joyfull things that happened at my house and wonder what else will happen at my house in the future. In this memoir the author tried to create a mood, so the reader could understand this memoir better. The mood the author created was very caring. The author talks about her \"Traditional Cuban Home\" he talks about the things that went on in her household, @CAPS1 For @CAPS2 the Passionate Cuban Music that was played, the armonos of the Kitchen, the innocence of childhood, and her life in her \"warm home.\" This shows that her family really loved and cared for one another. Also, Narciso Rodriguez said \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" This also shows the mood was love, and caring for each other. Lastly, Narciso Rodriguez talks about how grateful she is for what her parents did and sacrificed for her. She said she will never forget her graceful Neighborhood, she learned the real definition of family, and she was @CAPS3 her parents/family for turning her house into a home. The mood for this story was very loving, and caring. In \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from the story \"The @CAPS1 of Our Lives\", Narciso describes a mood of family and friends. He describes how his family always kept their arms opened, etc., to accept anyone who needs their help. He describes how his extended family always nearby. He describes the celebrations and the dinners that took place in his home. Most of all he described his home always had guests and family nearby. There were many different moods throughout the passage. One of them was in paragraph @NUM1. It was a party in there new home and everyone was enjoying themselves. They were all happy and excitedThe second mood was there friendliness in paragraph @NUM2. They were all from different parts of the world and got along and he even though they had there differences they got together as friends.The last mood was there love. Thare whole family got together on birthdays and sometimes on a random days and ate together. The Rodriguez family left there door open for any reletives who needed a place. They let them stay in there house for as long as they needed to get back on there feet. (in paragraph @NUM3.)@CAPS1 were the different types of moods throughout the passage for the Rodriguez family. The author created a very warm, cheerful mood in the memoir, using a happy tone throughout the story. First, Narciso talked about his New Jersey home that was re-created with Cuban tradition. \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" As you can see, Narciso has a great admiration to his Cuban tradition and showed it through the warmth he provoked in this sentence. Next, Narciso stresses how regardless of mixed heritage, everyone in the neighborhood came together like family, which creates a happy, safe feeling in the reader. Lastly, the author created a mood of feeling touched in the reader by explaining how much sacrifice his parents made for him to have a good life. Narciso strongly represented the love of his parents in this sentence, which the reader can feel. The author of this passage seems very happy about the way her life is today. She explains that her parents originally from Cuba arrived in the United States in 1956. She tells us about how she was born in 1961 and situated in a two family, blond brick building. She talks about growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense of family. She mentions that her parents raised her well and they made it seem like they were a extremely great family. The author of this memoir seems extremely happy and she thinks she found the definition of family The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is happines. @CAPS1 shows happiness by showing @CAPS1 wanted nothing more that to be with his family doing the things @CAPS1 loved, which @CAPS1 did. @CAPS1 also shows that @CAPS1 is greatful.  \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 feels @CAPS1 could never be as \"courageous\" as his parents and @CAPS1 thanks them for that, \"I've thanked them repeatedly.\" I think the overall mood of this memoir is joy and happines.There is a flowchart on the bottom of the page, @NUM1 columns: one is mood, the other support. Under mood is happy and grateful. Under support for happy is \"like @CAPS1 wanted nothing more\". For grateful is written (@NUM2). In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez he creates a mood of appreciation. He talked about how grateful he was that his parents selflessly came to @LOCATION1 to give their child a better life. Also, how his parents accepted how they wouldn't get the jobs they deserved. However, Narciso's parents knew that if their children got better lives it was worth it, which made Narciso feel incredibly grateful for his parent's sacrifice. He appreciated how his parents taught him the true meaning of \"family.\" In paragraph @NUM1 it says, \"And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love.\" The quote creates a feel of how grateful Narciso was for everything he had. The mood of Narciso's memoir is his appreciation for his family. The mood is created by the auther in the authe in the memoir by. \"Narciso Rodriguez and internally reconized @CAPS1 desiner, offers the following definition of \"family\".\" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 what and all the diffienetions of family and what a family is. \"Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my badysitter and my first friend) lived above us and Alegria graced our kitchen table more often than not\". Alegra was @CAPS4 as a part of the family not by blood not by chose but by @CAPS5 because @CAPS6 understand the Rodriguez's family @CAPS6 liked them so @CAPS6 becacme part of there family and they became part of her family. \"Here, the innocence of childhood the Congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\". When your away from Home every thing you do is different the way you sleep, eat, talk, react, is all different except when your home every thing is normal again. family isn't by blood but by heart of @CAPS5 and Home isn't where you live it's where familiy is it's where memoris are that's How the mood is set by the auther The mood created by the author in the excerpt \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is light-hearted. One piece of evidence of a light-hearted mood is in paragraph @NUM1 where it says, \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" @CAPS1 piece of evidence is in paragraph @NUM2 when it states, \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" Also, in paragraph @NUM3 it says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" In conclusion, I feel the author created a light-hearted mood.  The author created a mood of warmth and happiness. By talking about his parents cultural cooking and music gave a feeling of home. His parents graciously taking in people when things weren't going well for them, created a mood of the unity and friendship, along with the love for extended family. The author also creates a grateful mood through his parents' love and sacrifice, as well as there struggle to make there lives better. This also showed perseverance because Narciso's parents couldn't even speak english but they made it through that and created a wonderful life for their family. There is actually more than one mood that is set in this memoir. The most important one, though, is admiration. The author focuses his writing on the many positive actions and characteristics of his parents during his childhood. He admires their courage to come to @LOCATION1 in order to start a new life, despite hard times and rascism. He also praises their willingness to help other immigrants and stick with everyone while they create a new beginning. The other mood in the memoir is gratitude. The author looks back on everything his parents did for him many times. He credits them with turning their small, poor apartment into a home for him, and teaaching him the true meaning of being family. The author, in a way that reaches out to readers, thanks his parents for making him into who he is. The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and grateful. First, the setting contributes to the mood. The setting of this story is in a nice little home that had a happy environment, surrounded with family and friends. \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that\" family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" that quote shows that the neighborhood and the people in it all contributed to the happy mood. Second, the actions of the author's parents made the author happy and grateful. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Even though it wasn't easy for them, the author's parents @MONTH1 the sacrifice so the author could have a better life. This made the author's life happy, and the author was grateful. the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and greatful. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the mood set by the author is thankful. We can tell the author is thankful because, she says that she is thankful that her parents left Cuba for her to have a life in @LOCATION1. In paragraph five he says, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their childern a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" In paragraph six she says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This is another example showing that she is thankful. A third example is also in paragraph six when the author says, \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" This is saying that this person is thankful for the sacrifices and that they can not tell they're parents enough. In conclusion, from the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the mood that we can conclude is given off is that they are thankful for what they're parents have done for them.  Throughout the @CAPS3 the author @CAPS1 many moods to describe and fit what has happened in his memoir. One way the mood of the memoir is loving. From the @CAPS3 it tells how he had grown to understand what family ment even if he wasn't blood related to someone. This @CAPS5 the mood is loving because he is @CAPS4 Close to people in his life from everything that has happened to him. A second mood of what the memoir is, appreciative. A memoir is a true @CAPS3 witch tells true feelings behind what the author is saying about the @CAPS3. From the @CAPS3 explains how the author is @CAPS4 appreciative of his parents for going through @CAPS4 much for him, and providing him with things he's needed. This @CAPS5 its appreciative because it says that he has thanked them over and over again. Lastly the mood could be @CAPS2. The mood is @CAPS2 because in the @CAPS3 it explains how having family and friends over all the time made him enjoy everything because his family always had people over to have dinner with, and always had their arms open if Someone needed help, @CAPS4 this @CAPS5 that the mood could be @CAPS2. Overall there are many ways to describe the mood of the @CAPS3 from reading it. The book Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the memoir describes of her home and how grateful she was towards it. The author was gratefu her parents work toward the house because of how much time the parents had used in order to make the auther at her homeland. The declorations in the home were amazingly done to perfection. \"My young parents creates our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen\" (paragraph @NUM1). Shows how much love, time, sacerfice her parent put through to achieve such amazment. It is hard in order to turn \"one simple house into a home.\" (paragraph @NUM2). I feel like the mood in the memoir is being grateful for your family for many reasons.      My first reason is Narciso's parents came to @LOCATION1 from Cuba just to make sure that there kids will have a good life.       Another reason is his parents did hard labor and worked really hard to make he a good life. They also made there house feel like a home for their son.            There are alot of thing Narciso is grateful. In the memoir the author gives off a happy and greatful mood. He talks not have they changed their home into a tradition Cuban home, the hearth of which is the kitchen. Narciso says he is eternally greatful for the skill of cooking his parents gave him. They had \"family\" over all the time, and they would even let people stay over till they got back on their feet. He was greatful for them doing everything they could so their kids could have a greater life. They had also taught him the real definition of \"Family\" and he is greatful to them for ever more.

The family also loved their Cuban culture. The mood was also caring and friendly. The familes from all different countries cared for one another. I felt that all the people were warm and inviting. Everyone felt that they could trust each other and have each other over for dinner. The Rodriguez family really brought their culture to their new home and Narciso mentioned in the last paragraph that this is where he found out the definition for family while living in this neighborhood. The mood was created very clearly by the author in this memoir. The mood created by the author in this memoir is peaceful and loving. Narciso really believes that the definition of home is relationships & love rather than furniture and expenses. His home sounds really great because the way it is described in the memoir, you can see that his family are very caring and selfless people. The fact that his parents take in strangers and allow them to stay at their home really shows that they are very caring people. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, there are different moods created.One mood is @CAPS2. This memoir includes @CAPS2 because it reminds him about where he grew up and how comforting and loving his parents were. \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood where the many things I learned there about how to love.\" @CAPS1 mood is love. \"I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home.\" This shows how much he loves his parents and how much he loved his home.The last mood is, grateful. Although they were poor and lived in a @NUM1-room apartment, they were extremely grateful for that. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This shows how grateful they were.In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez, some different moods included are, @CAPS2, Love and being grateful for what you do have and not what you dont have. The author's mood is very grateful and happy. The author's parents were originally from Cuba, and arrived in the United States in 1956. The author moved into a modest, three- room apartment. Both the author's parents had rich culinary skills and a love for cooking. The author inherited his/her skills from his/her parents. They lived in a community of hard-working immigrants from @LOCATION2, Cuba, and @LOCATION3. The author's parents were very nice and friendly. They invited immigrants to their house to eat and celebrate the arrival of the United States. The author learned the real definition of \"family\" in his/her new home and community. The author is grateful to his/her parents for their love and sacrifice. The mood of this passage is very warm and personal. Narciso is very reflective in this passage about how his parents were so unselfish and gave up their life in Cuba to give Narciso a better life. Narciso goes on saying how unselfish his parents are, and how they take people in to give other people a better life not just themselves. Narciso's parents were very caring, and very meaningfull to him. He continues the mood by talking about what a true family is. How it's not just someone your blood related to, but who you care about and love. The mood created by the author in the memoir. Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing the memoir life was hard. Quite the contrary our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt recism. in their neighborhood despite customs elsewhere all of these cultures came together in great solidary and friendship. Over all these was hard for the author memoir In the memoir the author made a certain mood. The mood he made was loving and very alive. He constructed the mood of love in paragraph @NUM1 where he talks about the memories of his house always filled with comforting aroma of food and the passionate cuban music playing.  It also where he talks about how the memory of his home having the congregation of family and friends as the back drop of their warm home. Another example of the mood of love is in paragraph @NUM2 where he talks about how he was always surrounded by love ones during meals. He constructed mood of life in paragraph @NUM2 as well because he talks of how his house always became a sanctuary to his extended family member who lived with them until they got back on their feet. This gives the mood a sense of life because of all the people who have lived there. In conclusion this is the mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir. Narciso Rodriguez creates many moods in his memoir. In him memoir Narciso states \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.\" From this statement I feel the mood is loving and kindness.     He also states \"But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" This changes the mood to greatfulness and selflessness of the parents. The last statement I thought really changed the mood was \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" The mood when the author says that is I think thankfulness. Those are so examples of how @PERSON1 changed the mood thought out him memoir. The mood of the memoir is greatful. In paragraph @NUM1 It says in parentheses \"and for which I am eternally greatful.\" Also in the same paragraph in parentheses it says \"which I adore to this day\" about Cuban music. Lastely In the last sentence of the memoir it says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" The mood created by the author is in the memoir. The mood of the memoir is that he always be grateful to his parents and he will love his parents and sacrifice. Memoir told his parent that of the admiration for the strength and perseverance and thank them repeadedly. He said that he would never forget his parent that turned this simple house into a home. That the mood of the author in the memoir. The mood created in the memoir is I think comfort and happiness. First in paragraph @NUM1 \"Here, the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends the endless celebrations.\" These all make people happy childhood, family, friends and partys, so its no wonder that I think the memoir is happy. Also in paragraph @NUM2 \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family knowing that they would do the same for us.\" This puts a smile to my face that people are so giving to others when they don't have to, I hope it brings a smile to you to. Last in paragraph @NUM3 \"filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love.\" when I read this I think of nothing bad jut a family singing, laughing and all by a warm cozy fire place. It brings me comfort. Over all thats why I think the memoir is comforting and happy, The mood of the memoir is gracious. Rodriguez is grateful for many things listed in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS2 says @CAPS2 is grateful for his inheritance of the cuban culinary gift. In @CAPS1 @NUM2, by saying \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\" @CAPS2 shows his gratitude for his parents moved to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM3 @CAPS2 shows his gratitude for his parents love in the quote \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Rodriguez is also grateful for the love and hapiness of the home. @CAPS2 evidences this in paragraph @NUM4 in the quote, \"it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music and love. It was here where I learned the definition of family\". @CAPS2 goes on to say, \"I will never forget this house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love\". Rodriguez is gracious for his family, home, and life in this memoir. The mood created by the author in this memoir is that she is very grateful for everything of her parents had done for her and showed her. She is very happy for all the things she has and she admires her parents for their love and sacrifices they took. In this memoir she talks about how her parents came to the United States in 1956 and then had only a one-room apartment with her and her sister. They finally afforded to move into a three-room apartment. She finally called it a home (as she says in the article). She is very thankful for he family and important friends. She says they showed her lives, and these teachings have been the basics of her life. This is the author's mood in the memoir. Home: The Blueprints to Our Lives is a wonderfull memoir that tells what a \"home\" is truly about. It has a loveing and careing mood to with that shows that very thing.     Love is what the author, Narciso Rodriguez likes the most about his home. He talks about how he grew up and his parents took people in that needed support and helped them out.      Going on to talk about how his parents cared about him for them to come to @LOCATION1 for him, to get and have a good education and a better life. This is something that takes a couragous person to do and a person that loves and cares and wants the best for others. Because family sets of mood and that is love and careness. The mood of the memoir thatthe author istrying to create is happiness. As it saysin the story a love of cooking. The other thing is that the passionate Cuban music playing. This is why the mood is happy. Happy is the mood of the story because of what his parents did to get shelter and food. Heis also happy how his parents turned a simple house into a wonderful howe for everyone. Narciso isalso happy for what love and sacrifice his parents endured throughout the time of making their houseinto a home In this passage the mood to me is like relaxing and a soothing gratefulness towards his parents. The tone of his voice is not angry, not happy happy but soothing. Obviously Narciso loves his family and loves @LOCATION1. By the tone of the narrators voice shows that. Coming to @CAPS1 was a great change as he said because you leave behind so many friends, family and the presence of the culture. Family to Narciso is his relatives but culture as well. As you can see the tone of the narrators voice really makes the story interesting. The mood created by the author in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives is greatfulness, through out the memoir @PERSON2 talks about how he is greatful for his parents. @PERSON2 mentions that he grew up in a close knit community. @PERSON2 also talks about the sacrafices his parents had to make for him. In paragraph @NUM1 @PERSON2 says \"my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the jobs the deserved.\" @PERSON2 mentions that in Cuba his parents had really good jobs, and how they made sacrifices. Paragraph @NUM2 sums up the mood of the entire memoir. Paragraph @NUM2 starts with \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This line proves the mood of the memoir is greatfulness and that @PERSON2 is greatful for every thing his parents had done for him. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez gives her own definition of \"family\". In paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 that she adores the cuban cooking, and music. In paragraph: three, she states that her neighborhood were all family and they were all close. Stated in paragraph four, her parents would have everyone over (anuts, cosins, land lord ect). She also States that her parents would let people (family) stay with them until they could get back on there feet. Narciso parents seem like good parents, and she has a nice nieghbor hood When she was younger. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, calm, and kind mood. It is a happy mood because the author only talks about the good things that happened to him and his family. It is a very calm mood because nothing very exciting or nothing very sad happens, everything in the memoir is very calm. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is also a very kind mood because his parents are very kind. In paragraph @NUM1, \"my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. This shows that Narciso Rodriguez's parents are very kind people. Narciso Rodriguez creates a very happy, calm, and kind mood in his memoir. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives\" by Narciso Rodriguez, he shows how greatful he is that his parents were brave enough to come to @LOCATION1 in search of a better life. \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrafise.\" This shows that even though he @MONTH1 not be very wealthy he is grateful that his parents were brave enough to come to @LOCATION1 and try to get their children a better life. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This shows that he doesn't care as much what his house looks like but he does care how much his parents cared and worked to get where they are. Mood was created by the author in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez.\" The mood that he creates is a happy and proud mood. The author is happy to have had a wonderful family and was proud of what his family accomplished and proud of his home. Also the environment of were he was growing up taught him that \"family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. He sets a happy mood because of how he thinks of his whole community as a family. He was very proud of his mother and father. For example he says \"they came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\" And he also says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This is the mood I think that the author created in the memoir. Throughout the memoir, a very thankful and happy mood is shown. Narciso was raised in @LOCATION1, and knew why his parents had moved from Cuba, despite their love for the culture and weather. \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\" This quote shows Narciso's understanding of how much his parents gave up for him. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.\" This shows how happy and thankful he has been throughout his life because he was given the chance to grow up in @LOCATION1. \"I've often told them of my admireation for their strength and perseverance.\" Narciso's parents gave up alot to give him a better life, and he shows he will always be greatful for what they have done. The author created a reflective, happy, and grateful mood in the memoir. First, the author states in his memoir, \"I was born into this simple house... which I adore to this day... childhood... first friend.\" All these phrases show Narciso reflecting to his childhood, his first friend, and first house. Narciso reflects to his past, like how all memoirs should be. Secondly, the author uses words like \"great sense... adore... grateful,\" to show his appreciation and happiness of his childhood. To my knowledge, there aren't any grave, dark, sad parts of his life in the memoir. Finally, the author says that he is grateful for his rich culinary skills, passed down by his family, and his parents' love and sacrifice. This gives the mood of the memoir appreciation throughout the memoir, especially near the end, where he is grateful for his parents' selflessness. To conclude, the mood of this memoir is appreciation, happiness, and reflective. The mood of the memoir was warm and happy. The author talks about how is parents were poor and just moved to the United States from Cuba. He then says he had a wonderful life even though his family didn't have a lot of money. All that mattered was that they had their family and friends around them every day. Narciso says how his parents gave him the love and skill to cook and how he still has that love and his love for Cuban music. This memoir basically says how Narciso's parents were people who realized the more important things in life. It's not all about the fame and fortune. Its about love and family and spending time together. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because on the second paragraph all he talks about how his parents made a simple home very traditional Cuban home, and the very heart was the kitchen. Also \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being blood relative.\" Also his parents sacrifice a lot to get at the point where there at now. This is why the mood of the memoir is happiness. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.  Based on the memoir, the mood the author creates is warming and grateful.first of all, warming because in paragraph four @NUM1 and five lines @NUM2 through @NUM3 it states \"my parents always Kept thieR arms and their door open to the many people we consider family...\"@CAPS1 and finally, the author created the mood that @CAPS2 was gratful in paragraph(s) six line(s) @NUM4 the author States \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what the did was a much courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my Gratitude.\"In colclusion the authors mood(s) of the memoir are warming and grateful. The author creates a verry good mood in the story. It is a mood of well-being and happiness in their family. I think the author has a verry good bond with his family. I think that because he talks about being with his family alot listening to Cuban Music and eating dinner together. He also appreciates his parents alot because they left cuba to come to the United States so he would have a better life. In paragraph @NUM1 he says \"I will always be greatful to my parents love and sacrifice\". The mood created by the author is a warm and meaningfull adviroment. They made there house have a Cuban feel to it. They have passionate Cuban music playing, and aromas from the kitchen. Anyone who needs to stay at a place, stays there. His parents moved here and left everything  behind them, friends, family, and jobs. His mom and dad taught him that family and friends are the most important thing in your life. He said he learned the real meaning of family in his house and he says I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. In the artical Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1 edwards the mood created by the author the mood is happy and sad in different ways because he goes from like be nothing to living in a nice home and a good family and how his first birthday was and what his parents did to make him live a happy life in america. The mood of the memoir was heart-warming. The way Narciso Rodriguez wrote the memoir was looking back at his life as half full, not as half empty. Instead of pointing out or remembering the bad things about his childhood, he writes about the good parts of his childhood. For example, his parents gave him oppurtunitys despite their struggle. His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of rasism and segregation. Also because of his parents positive attitude, it made him a positive person. Another reason the mood was heart-warming was now Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are. Narciso's parents have given up and done so much for him, resulting in who Narciso Rodriguez is today, makes this memoir truly heart-warming. The mood set was a happy mood. As Narciso Rodriguez looked back on his life in @LOCATION1. He describes all the great experiences he had and the house he once lived in. He is also grateful because his parents gave up almost everything to provide him with a better life. He says \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. He is so grateful and happy that his parents loved him so much to trade thier lives in, so he could live in @LOCATION1 The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy, grateful, and loving. The @CAPS1 shares her background life with us. She expresses to us how she feels about her Passionate Cuban music, and her parents great cooking skills. \"A love of cooking that is still with me to.\" \"Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day filled the air.\" This shows that atl this time the @CAPS1 is grateful about her cooking and music. The @CAPS1 shows her self as a really grateful for all her parents have done for him. \"I thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age\". The @CAPS1 mood is so warming when she expresses her love for the parents, music, and cooking skills. The @CAPS1 creates many moods throught the memoir, but I think mostly she thankful for her family and heritage. The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood of the story was happiness. The reason why I said that the story was happiness was because she was happy that she was growing up. In the text it says \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me great sense\". Narciso Rodriguez was happy she grew up in the neighborhood she lives in. Her neighbors/friends were from Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. In conclusion that was the mood of the authors memoir of the article/story. The mood created by the author is a proud mood. He is proud of his culture the way he lived and how his parents were caring people. His parents always kept there arms and doors open for people to get back on there feet The author was gratefull. His parents moved to america for him. so he could have a good education. He can't thank his parents enough for moving. He tells them how much courage they have and thanks so much for leaving their jobs. He also talks about home. How home is a place you learn to love and admire your relatives. It doesn't even matter if your blood related. He will love you either way. In the memoir, the author describes his home enviroment while growing up. As a child, his home has given off a very happy and loving mood. One in which was created again in this memoir. When describing the culinary and musical habits in his home as a child, I can feel the happiness that the moment had possessed. Also, I can feel the love between himself and his constantly growing family that surrounds his kitchen table @TIME1. So, to me, this memoir gives off a great mood. One filled with happiness, love, and loyalty. Also with unity and friendship as well. The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez's  passage is loving and grateful. Narciso creates the image of a very happy childhood, while comparing her happiness to the hard work her parents toiled through and all the things they sacrificed for her. @CAPS1 often describes the feeling of closeness between her neighborhood and her family. 'In our neighborhood... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants..' Their family consisted of a variety of people, not necessarily related, but there was always a helping hand for each other in the community in times of trouble. \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family.\" The warmth of her childhood life is expressed in the line, 'Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' Narciso gives many examples of her happiness, but @CAPS1 always refers back to the hard work of her parents. @CAPS1 thanks her parents for giving her the opportunity to experience a better life. 'I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice...' I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.' @CAPS1 feels very grateful for her parent's strife to help her and for such an accepting neighborhood. The mood of the passage is loving and grateful. In the memoir. from \"Home The Blueprints of Our Lives\" by Narciso Rodriguez there is a certain mood created. I believe Rodriguez creates a \"thankful\" mood in his memoir. In the memoir Narciso talks about how his parents had successful lives in Cuba but came to @LOCATION1 so Narciso can have a better life. Narciso even said, \"they came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give there children a better life...\" @CAPS1 was thankful that his parents sacrificed everything for him. Rodriguez said, \"... even though it meant leaving behind their families, frineds and careers in the country they loved\"Rodriguez was also thankful for his parents turning \"this simple house into a home.\" His parents made his house feel warm and cozy. @CAPS1 leared the real definition of family living in this simple house.At the end, @CAPS1 said @CAPS1 could never be able to thank his parents for what they sacrificed for him The mood created by the auther in the memoir is.Love,\" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and scrifice\". This is shown in ph @NUM1.Care, \"Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet\". This is shown in ph @NUM2.faith, \"My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us\" This is shown in ph @NUM3 that is the mood created by the auther in the memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and good thoughts. Narciso tells us what it was like growing up. She gives us the idea that her and family were really close. She expresses to us how proud she is to be Cuban in many ways. Narciso tells us she enjoys cooking and so do her parents. She loves listening to Cuban music also. Narciso lived in a traditional Cuban home. Her home was not just a simple home, her parents created it into something more meaningful, something more special. The mood I get from this article is that even though Narciso Rodriguez grew up in a time of rasicm that his parents did everything for him and he was greatful a few exampls are in paragraph @NUM1 it states \"my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me theire rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and which I am internally greatul) then also in paragraph to there was a sentence that stated \"passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)...\" @CAPS1 are only some of the exampls in this memoir called - \"@PERSON1\" In the memoir, @PERSON1, the author creates a mood that inspires us to try our hardest and that mood is perseverence. The mood perseverence is expressed in the memoir in many ways. One way it is a stress is when @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 moved to the United States and lived in a one bedroom apartment. They finally saved up enough money to be able to move into a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. In this neighborhood the family raise as much money as possible to buy food for themselves and to help the people that were in need of anything from, water, shelter, and clothing. The reason they move from Cuba was to begin a better life in the United States which they never gave up until the day that they finally had enough money to live here. In the memory \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the mood created by the author in the memory is very kind. Firsty, he grew up with loving parents. For example it said in the memory that his parents would be excellent cooks that passed it down to him. @CAPS2 that they would have the time to teach him and learn. Next, he loved his parent so much. For instance, it says \"I will always be geateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 he didn't love them he woldn't be saying thoughs things. Lastly, he loved his home and was happy with it. For example in the memory it say that \"I would never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS2 that everyone he lived with and all of his familys he loved so much and his home was great with it all. That is why in this memory, the auther shows love and kindness as a mood to this peice. The author, @PERSON1 created a mood in the memoir. The mood he created was deffinitely loving and warm. For example, I would say this memoir's mood is loving and warm because the memoir kept mentioning how considerate, friendly, and passionate his family was. Also, he kept saying he learned what family was all about and he learned the true meaning of family. So, to me the mood in this memoir, is loving and warm. The author, @PERSON1 created a mood in the memoir. I think that there is a warm mood in the memoir. I think so because in the memoir, the author is talking about how thankful he is to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 destpite the hardships that they faced. Also, there is a warm mood to this memoir because the author is reminiscing about his past with sense a fondness for his parents and his neibhors. \"Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" In the memoir, the author often talks about how kind the people he grew up with were, and how good of a childhood he had. This is why I think the mood of this memoir was warm. In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is said in all different ways. In paragraph @NUM1 when she talks about her love for cooking the mood is calm with a dash of spice to it. Since she is Cuban I like to think the cooking is spicy. In paragraph @NUM2 she states, \"My parents always kept their arms and doors open to many people we considered family...\" That is a happy loving mood. To be able to say that means you have some pretty amazing neighbors. In paragraph @NUM3, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" That is the most important mood set in this memoir because she is thanking her parents for her life that she has. That is a very respectful thing to do. Everyone does it, but did you write a memoir about it? In the memoir, @PERSON1, from Home: The blueprints of our lives, there was a very solidary mood. The @PERSON1 family was so happy to be in @LOCATION1 and be free, and no longer in Cuba. It was a very loved environment with friends and family always coming to their table. They were a very caring family. They always had the arms and door wide open to other refugees until They got back on their feet. They were a happy, loving, and caring @CAPS1 family. The main mood through out this entire excerpt from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is one of thanks. Through out the excerpt, @ORGANIZATION1 about and explains about how his parents struggled in the US for their children. In his house, as it is said in paragraph @NUM1, \"My young parents created our traditional cuban home\" @CAPS1 loved everything about that home. Also his family. Not blood relatives just family. His family was made up of the entire community in a time, as discribed in paragraph @NUM2, \"When overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1.\" @CAPS1 is most thankful of his parents. In paragraph @NUM3 it discribes \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life... They struggled bothe personally and financially... My parents had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved\" His parents gave up everything for his current life and Narciso is forever greatful. This was a touching story of how this boy appreciates his family and parents so much. There is a mood through the story.Home to this boy is about family and relationships. He talks about how he liked the kitchen and cooking, just like his mother and father. That is a mood of happiness.The kitchen is why he loves. He talks about his Cuban culture and how he appreciates his parents bravery to come to @LOCATION1.The mood is mostly appreciation in the story. He is very appreciative. The mood of this memoir is that @PERSON1 is happy being with his family because he believes you should always love your family.                                                                                                                                                   Growing up in his environment instilled in him a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative, but his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. At this time racism, and segregation prevailed in the United States. Despite customs elsewhere, all the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.                                                                                                                                      It was a closeknit community of hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who were not necessarily their own kind, but were clearly in need of a helping hand.                                                                            The mood of this story is that everyone can come together in happiness and joy. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez had a warm down to earth feeling. Narciso expresses his love for everything given to him. I can tell he has a huge heart and it all starts at home. In the second paragraph he talks about his home life. Everything about his family gave me a warm sunny feeling. He sets the mood by talking about his amazing parents, they are wonderful. They incorporate their culture into everything. Food gives everyone a fuzzy feeling inside.Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives shows the warm welcoming feeling Narciso get when thinking about his family.   The mood in the memior of Narciso Rodriguez is one of admiration, satisfaction, and courage. Narciso had admiration for his parents who sacrifaced a set life for a better one for Narciso. His parents caring and unselflessly came to @LOCATION2 struggled personally and financially. He was satisfied with life he had. through family values and determination he was able to succeeb. Courage beacuse his family was able to give him a better life here eventhough they were better off in Cuba. It was struggled but they were determined to do it for Narciso. The mood overall is admiration. Admiration is the mood in the memior Narciso Rodriguez fashion designer from Newark, New Jersey. According to the memoir, the author created a mood to use in the memoir.The author created the mood of happiness. According to the memoir the author was very happy with his life. He was very joyful that he gained all the Cuban culture. He also is happy about all the \"family\" he has. So you can tell by the mood he has in the memoir that the arther is very happy and saticfied with the way he was raised.Thats how the authors mood would be described in the memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir is [Love] … I feel this is true because in paragraph @NUM1 it says \"I have been grateful to my parents for there love and sacrifice. Another reason is in paragraph @NUM2, it says \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and the love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally gratefull). And the final reason is in paragraph @NUM3 It says \"It was here where I learned the true definition of \"family\" And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love I believe that the mood in this memoir is happy because the athor is talking about his first friend (land loards daghter) the great cooking and music that his home had. how greatful he is to his parents for moving to america for him, all the celibrations they had for people, how everybody in the naborhood were friends, and much he loved his family. What about that is unhappy The mood created by the author in this memoir is over all warm. @CAPS1 explains the positive things about his home and where @CAPS1 grew up. @CAPS1 also explains the positive things about his family and culture, which @CAPS1 is very proud of. @CAPS1 says \"growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" @CAPS1's basically saying that @CAPS1 realized that all the people that lived around him came together and all connected somehow with their cultures, which made them all feel like family. @CAPS1 also explains how gratefull @CAPS1 is to have his parents who did so much for their children to have a better life. They did struggle at times, but the author is still happy for what went right in his childhood, and having all these wonderful people there. All of the people that came and left his house for all those years made him realize that \"family\" is just being around everyone you love and connect with which makes a house a home. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the over all mood is happiness. \"The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This quote explains how much he loved his child hood home. The last sentence in the memoir which says \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\", really shows how much he apreciates his parents hard work in the home they made for him. The author of this memoir seems to look back on his childhood happily though his family struggled finantially and personally. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez there were many moods created such as, upbeat, happy, and exciting. The first mood that the memoir showed was upbeat. \"Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This was very upbeat and welcoming tune to listen to in the kitchen rather than talking or silence. The second mood displayed in this memoir was happiness. \"All of these cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship.\" This is a happy thought and time when different cultures can come together to have friendship. The last mood that the memoir portrays is excitment. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations.\" This tells us that there are celebrations, and faimly and friends coming together, which is a very exciting time. In conclusion family and friends can make all the difference in a persons life, just as it did for Narciso Rodriguez. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" he expresses his gratitude toward his family. He describes why he is so thankful to have a neighborhood that is united together.Narciso Rodriguez includes a happy mood. He points out all of the positivities of his life. \"I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrafice.\" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) this is a quote showing that he'll do as much as he can to prove how lucky he is. Narciso thinks of his whole town as a family. They are united together and he knows that he is always welcome in their arms. In the memoir, the author creates a loving, caring and friendly mood. He creates this mood by describing the atmosphere of his home. \"Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" The setting of their warm, welcoming home contribute greatly to the mood of the memoir. The author's greatfulness to his parents selflessness and courage also contributes. \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" His greatfulness creates a thankful mood through paragraph six and seven, \"it was here were I learned the true definition of \"family\"\". This quote helps bring out the love in the mood. The warm, loving mood of the memoir really helps the authors point get across in a meaningful way. The mood described by the auther was warm and full of happiness. In the memoir, the auther @ORGANIZATION1 talks about the importance of his family Which always brings a comforting feeling. He Shared that he \"was born into a two-family blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New jersey\" but that it did not matter where he lived but who he lived with. The mood you get when you read this memoir is mixed because Of the way he describes his parents life, his life and his home. When he says \"the innocence of Childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\" he is talking about how close they all are and that, that is what matters, when you read that you feel the comfort, happiness, joy and compassion that he feels toward his life, his parent and everyone around him. The mood of this memoir is grateful. Narciso Rodriguez's parent both move to @LOCATION2 from Cuba to give their children a better life than what they had. Narciso's parents lived in a one room house untill they moved to New Jersey, were Narciso grew up. Inside that home the family created a beautiful Cuban communitie. The heart of the house was the kitchen. Where they played Cuban music all the time. The part of New Jersey were the Rodriguez family lived was filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants. The community was like a big family, \"the cultures cam together in great solidarity and friendship.\" All of these cultures that came together really showed Narciso what a \"family\" really means. She never would have know what that ment or have had these oppertunities if her parents hadn't been selfless. They came here and had to start their lives over. As Narciso says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the @CAPS1 create a mood in this memoir. \"Growing up in this environment instilled im me sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being blood related.\" That mean people that weren't blood related, he still constiders them an family. He also says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" That mean that evan though it wasn't a nice house it was still his home and he loved it. The mood of this memoir is love and he will never forget it. Thats the kind of mood in this memoir. The mood created by the author in the memoir. He felt @CAPS1 and curious my mother and father Had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved they struggled both personally and financially, braving the Harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardship. The mood created by the author is respectful. The mood is respectful because They came from cuba and went to @LOCATION1. as the @CAPS1 says \"My Mother And father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture\". Another reason why the mood is respectful is that the Mother and father went to this country for their child. As the @CAPS1 says \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\" This shows that they moved for the kid and not For themselfs. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the author create the mood was grateful for cooking skills and his parent's love.One way that the author is grateful is his cooking skills. The author is grateful for his mom and dad's cooking skills. For example. \" My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\"     @CAPS1 way   the author is grateful is his parent's love. The author is thankful for his parent. For example. \" I will always be grateful to my parent for their love and sacrifice.\" The author love his parent for the love and sacrifice.                                                                                                                                                                                                In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the author creates the greatfulness for his cooking skills and his parents love.                  The whole memoir gives off a very positive attitude. The author explains a feeling of unity and Friendship. This quote shows this, \"… all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in Friendship.\" The author is saying that despite the fact that they were living in times of racism, all different cultures and their neighborhood lived in peace. Paragraph @NUM1 has a feeling of caring. For others and love. The author explains how his mother and Father moved out of Cuba for better lives for generations to come.\" \"They came selflessly,… To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their Families, Friends, and careers in the country they loved,\" shows the feelings perfectly. The final part of the memoir presents great thanks to the authors parents. He states, \"I will always be grateful to my parents For their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1, in the last line of the memoir, the author describes the true mood of his house growing up. The memoir reads, \"I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home.\" The author is saying that his house was and just living space, it was full of love, caring, and great relationships. The whole memoir has a loving mood. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is gratefulness. Mood means the overall atmosphere of the authors words. I think that it is happyness, because no matter what happens, Rodriguez is always gratfull. She does not care if she lives in a simple house with a bunch of people, she is happy that she has a home. In paragraph @NUM1, she says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" I would have looked up to her, for being this gratfull and happy for what she has. Also, the last sentence she says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" These are a perfect example of the mood, greatfullness, and some of happyness. The mood created by the author was structured around many things. First of all, it is a light, warm, happy mood as the author describes how he grew up in a simple but loving neighborhood. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" It continues to be a friendly, cheerful mood throughout the whole memoir. It grows grateful and thankful, however, as the author describes how \"They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.\" @CAPS1 he sets a mood which fluctuates and changes throughout the memoir. It moves from warm and fuzzy to thankful and back again. The mood created in the memoir is love and care because this family of Cuban use to live in a @NUM1 apartement building now the live in a @NUM2 bedroom apratment. Now they are inviteing people in treating people and family member's with love and care and that will rub of the kid's and it is a good thing that they did that and Also that the neighborhood was good. The mood created by the author is your family will always be there for you, a quote from the story is \"I will never forget how my parents made this simple house into a homeThe mood might also be there are always better opertunities in life. What I mean is that Narciso Rodriguez's parent's moved to @LOCATION1 for a better opertunity for their kids. \"It was here were I learned the real definition of \"family\".\" \"And for this I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love .\"  I think the mood that the author created was a happy mood and a mood that makes you appreciate what you have. And to always remember where you came from, and to always love family. At some points in the memoir the mood become more about @CAPS1, for example in \"paragraph @NUM1\" he tells how his neighborhood growing up was made up of many races including Spanish, Cuban, and Italian, and he tells how they all came together in solidarity and friendship. He also says how his family was always helping each other.In conclusion, I believe the main mood in this memoir would be @CAPS1 and coming together wether it be as a family, or as people. In this memoir, the author created a proud and glad mood.The author, Narciso Rodriguez, showed how proud he was of his family and home through his memoir. His parents left their home in order to make a better life for him and for that he is extremely proud and grateful. His parents also allowed other immigrants to stay with them temporarily. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, \"what They did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done.\"Narciso shows how glad he was that he got to grow up where he did. He had his parents, as well as all of his neighbors, which he considered his family. Though his apartment wasn't the nicest place to live, it was his home. He was happy there and always had people around him who loved and cared for him. In paragraph @NUM2 he says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.Narciso shows his proud and glad feelings through his memoir. The mood of the author is @CAPS1 and grateful because his parents left Cuba and were very nice people. They let people live at there house. When the didnt have much money, the took any job the could get so they could care there son, Narciso, they had a three bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate their arrival to this country, they also had there house full of love and life. Also they came to this country with not knowing how to speak this language. So the mood of this story at the author seems to be proud. I think the mood of the memoir is comforting and happy because it talks about how a simple house became a home. The memoir shows how a family can turn a random house into a home would love and by selflessly letting people stay with them until they can get back on their feet. The memoir also shows how family has nothing to do with being blood relaited, it's about being their for one another in a time of need. I think that shows a great amount of comfort and happiness, knowing that a simple apartment could become a loveing home, filled with family and love. The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich Culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which @CAPS2 is eternally greatful. That @CAPS1 that @CAPS2 loves to follow his parents goals and @CAPS2 loves them very much. In addition, @CAPS2 will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2 has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. @CAPS2 loves them for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS2 has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity and pressed upon him as such an early age, and how @CAPS2 knows how important family and friends are. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is greatfulness.Throughout the memoir, the mood created is greatfulness. There are many quotes in the memoir that support the mood created. One quote is \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1's greatful for his parents giving him a better life in @LOCATION1 and raising him up to be a good guy. The mood created by the author is a good @CAPS1 mood it describes His and His familys struggles but very @CAPS1 @CAPS3 even thow they @CAPS4 behind jobs, Friends and Family there all very @CAPS5 and @CAPS1 to enjoy there Lives in New Jersey withe there Cuban setting The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and happy. I think the mood is nice and happy because @ORGANIZATION2 shows @CAPS1 for his parents, grandparents, and his house. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage talks about @ORGANIZATION2's hometown, culture, and etc. It also talks about what he is grateful for and that would be his parents, and passionate Cuban music. In conclusion that is what I think the mood is which is nice and happy in the story Narciso Rodriguez. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a sense of family. He says how when his parents came up to Newark, New Jersey, from Cuba, they had to start all over and find a new beginning. They passed on their rich culinary skills and love for Cuban food in the kitchen of a three-room apartment in a two family building. He says that the community was all a different race but they all became a big family that got through the racist times of the United States in the '@NUM1. He says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their extreme love and sacrifice. He reminds them constantly about how grateful he is and that he can't believe how they did it. So the mood in this memoir is about family. In this memoir the mood varies. In paragraphs three and four it was a \"giving\" mood, for example explained in paragraph four \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.\" It shows right in the sentence that they gave people in need what they needed in difficult times. In paragraphs six and seven the mood was thankful and happy for the sacrifice his parents gave for him. Because of her future. In paragraphs one and two the mood is happy and comfy because she is happy about her home, her family and the love she has been given in her life. These are the various moods in the memoir. In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, he speaks of how his family, related or not, provided the happiness and wonderful memories of his childhood that he adored so much. The overall feel to the memoir, or its mood, was expressed as gracious and thankful to his family, but also warm and happy, creating pictures in the reader's mind of a lovely childhood. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" said Rodriguez, showing his thanks to his parents for allowing him to grow up in @LOCATION1. He knew that many immigrants risked everything to come raise their children in @LOCATION1 and for that he is thankful. He also praises the other families of different cultures in his neighborhood, giving more of a grateful atmosphere to the memoir. \"It was a close-knit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people in need.\" The mood of the memoir is happy and warm as Rodriguez describes his cozy home filled with music, sweet smells, and letting people. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family, and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home.\" Rodriguez's mood and feeling is clearly expressed in his descriptions and memories. The mood is the @CAPS1 is happiness, for example at the end he says you can find happiness anywhere and he did. He found it  in a abandoned home. The @CAPS1 sayes that he got All the thing his parents didn't get. That show happiness. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he gives a mood throughout it. I think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, \"the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.' Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven. In \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from \"Home; the @CAPS1 of Our Lives\" @CAPS2 Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a warm, pleasant mood. He does this in several ways, one being him writing about how the overcome segregation. He says that \"...Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants... In our neighborhood,...all of these cultures came together in great solidary and friendship.\" In this manner, he creates a bright feeling @CAPS2 saying that even when segregation was dominant, everyone in his community was friends. Another way he mixed the story pleasant sounding is how he talks about his parents. Althroughout the excerpt he, talks how greatful he is to his parent: mainly @CAPS3 of how kind and loving they were As he puts it, \"They came selflessly... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" @CAPS2 giving up their lives, they were able to make others' lives better. Due to this, he is greatful for the love and support his parents offer to him @CAPS3 of the uplifting theme of the story, Narciso Rodriguez creates a smooth, pleasant, warm, and loving tone. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very upbeat happy one. This is because he uses the memoir to describ how happy and upbeat his house was as a child. He does this by saying \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This indicates a happy mood because the son is very happy that his parents love and sacrifice helped pave the road to his future. That is why the memoir has a happy mood. The mood by the author by his memory was happy, thankfull, because he sais that his house in New Jersey bring happy memoris like for example his kitchen were his parends shared cooking duties and unwittinegly and the kitchen were he loved to cook. or his neighborhood were all of Spanish cuban and italian immigrants were there customs despid, all of this cultures came together in great solidary. or were his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family. or were he feels grateful with his parents for their love and sacrifice he often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then he could have ever done.. he will never forget How his parents turend that simple house int a Home..  In Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1, there was a mood created throughout the story. What was the mood?     In paragraph @NUM1, the mood was joyful and heart-breaking. \"Situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section.\" It shows how Narciso felt about her home in New Jersey back in 1961.     In paragraph @NUM2, the mood was memorable and grateful. \"What they did was a more courageous thing that I could've ever done.\" It shows that Narciso's parents had always done courageous thing.     In Narciso Rodriguez by @PERSON1, there was a mood created throughout the story. In conclusion, the mood can always help the story flow and work so well. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from \"Home: The Blueprints of our Lives,\" the mood is portrayed as very cheerful, warm, and happy. The way that the author described his home and early years provided an image of a large happy family throughout the passage. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it states \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\"  This portrays the image that life in the author's home was friendly and loving. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says \"countless extended family members came and went - and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet.\" This means that their family was very close and would always look out for eachother. So in conclusion, the mood in this memoir is portrayed as very happy, upbeat, and loving. The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir shows him that he is grateful to have a home to live in When he was born by his parents. He was happy to live in a family that is unity and have friendship with others. He has learned the definition of \"family\" and know what a \"family\" is like and he respects his family for having a great home in @LOCATION1.

Hw is proud of his Cuban background and culture. He is also happy his parents kept their homes open to everybody. He is grateful for his parents sacrifice and love. Those are the overall moods of the memoir. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood author created is thankfulness and gratefulness towards Narciso's parents, family, and friends for making his house a home and also gratefulness toward just his parents because they gave him a better life. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage. without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" @CAPS1 saying this Narciso is expressing thanks and graditude toward his parents. In the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2 it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Narciso is clearly stating his gratefulness toward his parents. In the last sentence of the memoir it says \"I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house while home.\" @CAPS2 Narciso is thinking his parents. In paragraph @NUM3 it says \"It was here I learned them real definition of family.\" @CAPS3 it weren't for Narciso's parents, friends, family, and home, Narciso wouldn't have learned the real definition of \"family.\" The mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez gratitude. The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that when he arrived in the United States he was given the opportunty that so many immigrants wanted and that was education. His parents still carried that cuban culture they had that was especially in their kitchen because both his parent loved making food, and they had great culunary skills which he learned. They would have cuban music going while they were setting the table. The @CAPS1 tells us that when his parent were still in Cuba his dad worked in a laboratory and his mother had studied chemical enginerring. The @CAPS1 says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" There are a few ways to describe the mood the @CAPS2 created in this memoir. They description im going to give is the @CAPS2 created a very happy & loving mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1. it say's \"Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" That means that family doesnt have to be blood related for you and that person to unite and became very good friends. Also another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done.\" That shows she's a very loving and caring person to actually be @CAPS1 for something your parents have done. Those are a few way's to describe how the @CAPS2 created this happy and loving mood. The mood of this memoir is good. It's good because everybody is happy. Narciso is in a good mood and inviting everybody into is his. The excerpt says... \"My door will always be open\". Also in there house's they have music going on all the time. The excerpt also says... \"In our meighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship\". There were also very unselfish, caring of everyone, and did whatever they could for there families. In this memoir there was a overall pretty good mood of everybody because they were nice, inviting, and caring. In the memoir @PERSON1, the mood of the author is @CAPS2. The author is from Cuba who lives in a modest three-room apartment. That is big coming from a one-room apartment. The author says that they turn this little space into a cuban home. One reason @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 is because his house was always filled with love, friends, and family. @CAPS1 is also @CAPS2 of his parents. @CAPS1 says \"they came to this country with such courage.\" @CAPS1 also says \"I will always be @CAPS2 to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The author loves his parents and is very @CAPS2 for all they have done including \"turning this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS2 his mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood created by the author of this memoir was very warm and loving. He talks about his family and friends throughout the piece, and how much they have changed his life. He talks about Cuba and its culture flowing through the home, how his parents threw their careers away so that their children can have a good life, and how everyone in his neighborhood was very close knit as if they were a family. All these aspects of his life thrown together with words like \"faith\", \"struggle\", \"admiration\" and \"selflessly\", among many others, makes for a very compelling piece that has a strong heartfelt mood. The are many strong feelings in the memoir but @CAPS1 is the most important one. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\", Narciso Rodriguez talks about all of the sacrifices and Love in his house hold and how @CAPS2 is forever great full for his parents selflessness. \"Love of cooking that is still with me today (and for what I am extreemly greatfull)\" is what Rodriguez says @CAPS2 appricietes. @CAPS2 is also appriciative for the way @CAPS2 grew up and how his parents taught him that \"family had nothing to do with being a blood realetive.\" @CAPS2 is so appricietive that @CAPS2 tells his parents constantly that @CAPS2 \"will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The author excpetially ex presses the mood of @CAPS1 in the line, \"I will never ferget that house or its gracious naighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" Rodriguez is forever appriciative to his parents and their strong desitions that made him the person @CAPS2 is today. The mood of the memoir is actually happy and grateful. I think this because the kid thanked his parents for letting them move to @LOCATION1 and all of them were happy that they took this sacrifice, Narciso especially. Narciso always thanks his mom and dad for thier bravery. He @CAPS1 he thanked them repeatedly and he could never have enough bravery to do that. That is how it is grateful. Something about the story has a very happy feel to it. Because the family is together and they are talking about how happy they are living with each other and even in @LOCATION1 it adds a very happy feel to it. That is what I think the author tried to create in the memoir. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" Narciso tells all about his parents and how greatful he is. Narciso created a mood during this memoir, he talked about his mom and dad and how they created his house into a home. Narciso's parents sacrificed a lot to move to @LOCATION1 and give their children a good life, even if it meant them having to leave behind family, friends and careers. The mood created overall was that I felt thankful for my home and family here in @LOCATION1. Then I also felt sympathy for Narciso's parents for leaving everything behind for their children. they also had to leave behind family, which is very hard to do. Narciso's parents made a very tough but wise deisicon but in the end it was worth it. The mood created by the author in the memoir I would have to say a loving mood because through-out the whole memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about how loving and caring and selflessness his parents were. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it states \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" Also near the end of paragraph @NUM1 it says \"In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times.\" @CAPS1 are two reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says \"countless extended family members came and went- and their was often someone staying with us temporarily untill they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" That is the final reason of why I think the mood of the memoir is a loving mood. In the memoir, @PERSON1, by @PERSON1, he talks about how thankful he is. One thing is that he is thankful for his babysitter and friend giving them food when they needed it. Also he was thankful for the community he had. Lastly, he was thankful for his parents' love and sacrifice.He said that \"@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table more often than not.\" (@NUM1, Rodriguez) this shows he everybody helped each other out.Next he says that \"our neighborhood... Came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" (@NUM2, Rodriguez) this how close-knit Rodriguez's community was. Lastly, he says that \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This shows how thankful he is toward his parents for sacrificing almost everything for him.By Narciso Rodriguez wrote this in a thankful mood. He thanks his babysitter, he thanks his community, and he thanks his parents. All of them contributed to his life. The mood that is @CAPS1 and that it is created by the author in the memoir is the feeling of being thankful. This is the mood @CAPS1 because it says \"Their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" This @CAPS3 the mood is thankful because author is thankful for the culinary skills that is still with him. Another that @CAPS3 the mood thankful is when it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" This @CAPS3 the mood thankful because @CAPS5 is thankful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. Another that @CAPS3 the mood as thankful is when it says: \"I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done.\" This @CAPS3 the mood as thankful because @CAPS5 is thankful for all they have done and @CAPS5 could never be more courageous than them. This is the mood of the memoir created by the author. The mood created by the author is a warm happy mood. This is because he is talking about the love and bonds of family. He also is talking about home and how a house can become a home. He also talks about how he and most people are grateful for family and friends. All of this blends together to form a happy, good, warm mood to the story. In the excerpt of the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood created is one of love for family and friends. The author explains his parents reasons for immigrating with such love and devotion that it is hard to not feel the same way. The author describes how everyone would eat together and they often had many more people eating with them. The author says \"...countless extended family members came and went...\" and then continues on to describe how his family lets other family members come stay with them until they get back on their feet. The author really shows the mood of the excerpt in a loving way and does this the most when saying you will always be grateful to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 for him. The author shows that he truely cares about his family. The mood created by the author was grateful. The mood is grateful because he gives thanks to his parents For \"... their love and sacrifice\" (¶@NUM1). This memoir is based on the definition of family. Rodriguez explains that Family means many things. It means helping others, accepting everyone, and for his parents giving up your life so your children could have a better one. He recalls the many people his mother and father help. The people in his neighborhood that were not related by blood but were still his family. The courage and selflessness of his parents leaving their country to start over. He tells them of his \"...admiration of their strength and perseverance\" (¶@NUM1). There is still \"no way to express my gratitude\" (¶@NUM1), he also states. He will be forever grateful to his parents for these lessons that have formed his life. The mood in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez stays constant through out the story. First, \"growing up in this environment in stilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative\". This quote talks about when Narciso's mom and dad take people in their house that need a home, but they are not blood relative family. Second, \"my mother and father came to this country not knowing the culture of language to give me a better life.\" Even though his mom and dad knew nothing about the language or culture in @LOCATION1, and didn't want to leave friends and family, @ORGANIZATION1's mother and father sacrificed it all to give @CAPS1 a better life. Finally, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS2 means that its a simple house but it turned into a safe home with all the people @CAPS2 loves around him. All in all, the mood of this memoir is happy. The author makes all his challenges happy. In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez the @CAPS1 sets a mood of relaxation, happiness, joy, and an overall feeling of over satisfaction and unity. The @CAPS1 describes his feelings of being at his home and how much it made him feel overjoyed. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" In this particular sentence the @CAPS1 is tring to get the mood as like a heaven on earth thing. The @CAPS1 while tring to give the reader factual information about his home, is also tring to exagerate the emotion and make it paradise. In paragraphs @NUM2, @NUM3 and @NUM4 the @CAPS1 emphasizes how courageous, kind, and selfless his parents are and how he will always be greatful to them for that. He shows it in statements like \"They came selflessly...to give their children a better life\" and \"Generosity and selflessness are two lessons my parents did not just tell me. They showed me their lives.\" The @CAPS1 sets the mood in the story as paradise for everyone. The @CAPS1 Created in the @CAPS2 is Not that of a @CAPS3 one. The @CAPS1 Created is cheerful and happy, as the narrator talks about his family and childhood. @CAPS4 talks about how his Neighborhood consisted of many races. as stated in paragraph @NUM1 \"Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants.\" @CAPS4 talks about how they all live together in peace and @ORGANIZATION1. This @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that the meaning of family does not nesecarily mean you have to be related. The @CAPS1 is happy and @CAPS6 that friends are family too.  The mood that was created by the author in the memoir was happiness, love, unity, and satisfaction. These words describe the mood because in the memoir the author would talk about how eternally greatful he is for his family. He talked about the struggles they had but how they saw past them and realized that as long as they have each other thats all that matters. They got along great and were very happy they had each other. They also helped other people in need which seemed to complete their lives. They saw everyone as family and as little as they had, all they wanted was to give back. That was the mood created by the author.  The mood created by the author in the memoir is, happy, proud of his parents and proud to be a Cuban. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he states \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" His parents gave up their wonderful jobs in Cuba and now are working jobs that they don't like. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso says that this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with a blood relative. Narciso is grateful for his parents and grateful for being in @LOCATION1. The memoir has a very happy mood to it. Paragraph @NUM1 gives a real feeling for what the authors home was like. It talks about the food and the music that the author emphasises his love for. Paragraphs @NUM2 and @NUM3 give information on how close the comunity was. The author talks about how great his friend Alegria was and says she \"graced\" their kitchen. Throughout the memoir, the author explains how happy his home was and with his detailed descriptions the reader gets a feel for the happiness too. This article @PERSON1 has created a different mood for me. I was first bored  but now I'm more grateful of my parents. My parents had also moved from a different country to the United States. They moved from @LOCATION2 to here @CAPS1 the children could have a better life and education. This article also says that close friends can also be family and now that I think about it, I think it's true. The author says \"growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being blood relatives. That's the kind of mood this author created for me as I read this memoir. In \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the most imp-ortant thing is love. It talks about how much Narciso cares for his family.The mood is love, admiration and gratefulness. Narci-so is so grateful for what his parents did for him. To give up everything to go to a better place. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" says Narciso. Another m-ood is also love. In the memoir it express-es a great deal of love that's in his family. \".. It meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved\". They gave up everything for Narciso who they truely love. You get the feel of admiration when Narciso says \"They showed me with thier lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life\".The overall feelings of the memoir is love, admiration and gratefulness. Narciso learned a lot from his family. \"I will never forget how my parents turned his simple house into a home\". In this memoir the author gives the mood a sense of inspiration, as well as the love of family and friends. In the memoir the author talks about how great it is that the author's parents had turned a simple ordinary house into a home, which means that the author's parents had made thier house to feel like home by bringing their Cuban culture into the house, such as Cuban food, Cuban music, and Cuban decoration. That makes the memoir a happy mood. But there is also inspiration to this memoir because it basically tells readers that it doesn't matter who your blood relatives are, family is family, people who love and care about you the most. The mood of this memoir is very happy and loving. Throughout the story Narciso shows how much he apreciates that his parents gave him the oportunits to grow up in @LOCATION1. He shows to me that this in memoir is loving by explaining how his mom and dad always had there arms and dores open to any body they considered family. The memoir is happy because it shows that he has a lot of good relations with many people that he calls family. He is also happy because he knows how much it takes to move from your home country to @CAPS1. Overall Narciso had a very happy, loving childhood. The mood created by The author is happy and warm tone. In paragraph @NUM1 he recalls enjoying cuban music and learning to cook. He also recalls making friends with other imigrants and learning to love and help everyone. (@NUM2) In paragraph @NUM3 he recalls learning the true meaning of family and what it means to make house, a home. The mood created is warm and loving and teaches the true meaning of family and of selfless behavior and that home is about The family, not the space The mood the author created in the memoir was happiness and satisfaction. I know this because in the story the main character is happy. As he arrives in New Jersey he enjoys how his parents create their house looking like a traditional Cuban home. He is passionate of the Cuban music that he adores listening too everyday. Another thing is that the main character is satisfied of what his parents do for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The last thing is that he is thankful to his parents because in paragraph @NUM1 it says \"@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thank them repeatedly.\" These are the moods the author created in the memoir. The mood created in Rodriguez's memoir is one of gratefulness + happiness. There are supporting feelings such as coziness + friendlyness but Rodriguez himself most exhibits gratefulness. In paragraph @NUM1, there is a great catalogue of gratefulness to the social skills that were passed down to him. When in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about their cuban feast, a small one perhaps but with true love + life. You get a true sense of the gratefulness Rodriguez displays for his parents not because of who they are or how much money they have or what they give him (materialistically), but being genuinely grateful of the nature + kindness bestowed to him. In the memoir \"@PERSON1\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author creates a positive, greatful mood. The author \"will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\" I know because a writes a few paragraphs just to show how thankful @CAPS1 is to his parents. @CAPS1 describes how great their jobs were in Cuba and then how poor they became in the @LOCATION1, but yet they still worked hard to give their children a better life. \"In a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country where I celebrated my first birthdays.\" @CAPS1 describes everything, as a positive learning experience, but shows that throughout the memoir, the theme is positive and greatful. The mood in this memoir is gratitude. Narciso is so greatfull and proud to have grown up where he did and have the family he had \"In our neighborhood despite customs  elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" Narciso is telling the readers that even thogh the people in his neighborhood were all different, they were still family. \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This quote tells you that even though things were ruff he still is gratefull for all the opertunities his parents gave him. the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy for remember the most important peoples on his life, the poor house were he lives when he had his first birthday and a different kind of people in the place were his family live, he was grateful for everything to his parents gived to him when he was a little boy and the education how his parents give it to him. Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates and overall mood of love and compassion for family and shows the strength of his own family. Narcisco explains that his parents love of cooking and willingness to let other people in \"instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood realative.\" Also, this memior shows people facing hardships. Narciso explains his neighborhood, and family overcame racism together. This sets the mood that they love eachother. Lastly, this memior shows love and sacrifice. Narciso explains that his parents \"struggled both personally and financially.\" during their move to @LOCATION1. But Narciso's parents still showed him to love. From his parents, Narciso has learned to love, and for that he admires his parents. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez the author's mood is happy, @CAPS1 he says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" And @CAPS1 he loves his family and friends. oh so dearly. He is also grateful to have a lot of his family members who are close to him. That could get together for dinner and a lot more. The author says \"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music life and love.\"As you can see in the memoir the author felt happy and grateful @CAPS1 of the love and sacrifice of his family. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez is an internationally recognized clothing designer. He talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, he offers the true definition of \"family\". I felt like the mood was comforting, and loving, and heart-warming. Just by the way he talks about how much he loves his Cuban heritage, and how his mother and father immagrated from Cuba, to @LOCATION2, and how, even at a young age, they still managed to raise him, and do alot for him, and give him the best childhood they could give him, that he'll always remember. He also talks about how \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative\", meant that you could even consider someone not blood related to you, as your own flesh and blood, family. The mood created by the author of the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is generally a happy and memorable one. The author describes how his parents came to @LOCATION1 and had to start all over. However, the author's parents are still very kind and turn their neighborhood into one big family. The parents cook and celebrate things with the neighbors. The author says he is very proud that his parents were such caring people. The mood of this story is overall very happy, sharing, caring, and grateful because of how nice the parents were. The author states \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.\" The memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is a very inspiring and happy memoir to read, with the mood to match it. In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a mood of joy, and hope. His parents came to @LOCATION1 in a time of racial segregation. they persevered through the hard time with their child by having close bonds with Friends and Family that lived nearby. Culture was passed on to Narciso and he loved the @CAPS1 and music he grew up with. Narciso's @CAPS2 always invited Family into their home when they needed help. Also, many people that weren't related to them shared dinner with them each night. In the Rodriguez's home, there was hope to get better and joy For the moment. The mood by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is happy. When the author talk about his or her memoirs it seemed like they felt happy having those memoirs to talk about. Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you. That is what I think the author's mood is. The author creates a gratefull mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 the @NUM2 sentence the author states \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" This @CAPS1 that the author is gratefull enough to have parents even though they are not his biological blood related parents. In paragraph @NUM3 In the first @NUM4 sentences the author is talking about how his parents came to this country with carage and without speaking the language or knowing the culture. He also mentioned in those sentences how to give their children a better life meant leaving behind families, friends and careers in their original country. This @CAPS1 that the author is also generous because he realizes the love and sacrafice it takes to do this. Also, In paragraph @NUM5 sentence @NUM4 he says that he has told his parants that what they did was brave because he would have never been able to do what they did. It really displays how grateful the author is, and how much he admires his parents. The author created many feelings in the memoir. First, the author created a warm and loving mood; \"I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This quote shows how much passion is behind his families love and it makes you feel warm and comfortable inside. Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship.\" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the begining of the memoir; \"Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This quote shows that the author's family celebrated life and created upbeat feelings. In conclusion, the author of the memoir created many feelings for the reader. In \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, many moods were shown and created in the memoir. One mood shown in the memoir is great love. In paragraph three, Narciso wrote, \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" @CAPS1 mood described in Narciso's memoir was gratitude. In the final paragraph, the author wrote, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" A last mood produced in the memoir was pride. In paragraph two, Narciso wrote, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Many positive emotions were created by Narciso Rodriguez in his great family memoir. In the story Narciso Rodriguez the mood of the auther created was very peaceful. It was saying how it was a traditional cuban home and there was passionate cuban music that filled the air. There was also the mixing of the aromas in the air coming from the kitchen. There's tons of loving people around the house too. Which makes it home and comfertable. The mood was always happy and everyone loved to cook so they would always do that together even though they wernt blood related. \"Within the walls, my young parents created created our traditional cuban home, every heart of it was in the kitchen. As you can tell this family loves being together and enjoys eachothers company In this article, the authors mood seemed to be happy and good. For example he likes that his parents are selfish and hard working people and tried to make his life happy. He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family. He also likes how they tought him things that they know how to do such as cooking. His mood did seem to change when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit eser then how it was in New Jersey. They tried to make as much as they could and his mood seemed to be a bit worried. His mood changed to be happy again when he menchened that he loves the way they treat their house like a real home. The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to \"start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find.\" Back in Cuba, \"Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering.\" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved.\" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir. Based on a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a specific mood is created. First, the author tells about a love of cooking in the kitchen with his family and the meaningful Cuban dishes prepared there. This creates an atmosphere of passion. Rodriguez describes, \"passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen\" (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows the passion the author has for his culture and traditions. Second, the author talks about the relationship he has with this neighborhood. A mood of passion is created based on the authors loving emotions towards his unofficial family. The author writes, \"My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family\" (paragraph @NUM2). Finally, the author shares his gratitude towards his parents and all that they have done for him. His passion for their strength, perseverance, and teachings create a passionate atmosphere. The author says, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrafice\" (paragraph @NUM3). Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir a passionate mood is displayed.  The mood created by the author in this memoir is comforting. His memoir shows his past life and how he felt about it. Cuban music filled the air, tables of Cuban feasts, different kinds of people interacting, all that is the mood he's trying to express about his life through his memoir. He's also showing his appreciation for his parent for making sacrafices for him so he could have more opportunities and education. He's also being very descriptive about his childhood and showing the type of life he had and what he and his parents had to go through when they came to @LOCATION1 and how they don't want people going through the same thing as them so they helped Immigrants who needed support. The mood is obvesoly love, and greatfulness. \"(And for which I am exernally greatful).\" The boy is young so he doesn't quite get how big that move for them was. \"In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely.\" This means leaving family, friends, @CAPS1 new jobs, a house to put over his head, and leaving their home to give a great one for their son. He is thankful that his parents were still able to keep his cuban life alive. They didn't forget where they came from.Now I think about it one of his moods could be sad because he was the reason for all that happend. What happen if he was never born he would ever never found out what family means. That is why in this memoir has some greatfulness, some love, and that little bit of sadness. The mood created in the memoir @ORGANIZATION1 is happy & warm. The memoir is happy & warm because it describes how a small home & be very happy like in paragraph @NUM1, it says \"always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.\" This shows that love fills the air which is happy. That is how the author creates a mood. In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until \"they got back on their feet.\" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author.      In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez speaks with nothing but warm fondness and gratitude as she describes her childhood home.

Obviously, she is very grateful for everything her parents did for her and the chance for her to grow up in such a tender community - where \"'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" (@NUM1) The entire memoir is written with such care and attention to sweet detail. The author clearly feels blessed that her parents sacrificed their safety in their homeland to bring her to @LOCATION1 in order for her to live a better life, to experience the importance of friends and family, and to learn about the true meaning of love through Cuban culture. The mood in this memoir is one of gratitude. This is first seen in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about cooking and Cuban music. It is also in paragraph @NUM2 when he talks about leaving their home countrys. A third time is seen in paragraph @NUM3 when he tries to say thank you, but can't find the right words.

And that is the mood of the story. What living with his immigrated parents in the United States, the author created a mood with the memoir. First, in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso explains that part of the warmth in his home is by having endless celebrations with family and friends. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 he stated, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

Narciso is stating how impressed and generous his parents were and he realizes how important friends and family are in paragraph @NUM2. Narciso also states in paragraph @NUM2 that the two lessons that he learn wasn't just taught, but were shown by his parents lives. I think that this story was very touching and created a lot of mood and emotion as I was reading. The mood created by the author in this memoir is a warm and happy one. He does this by talking about homes, friendship and his neighborhood.                                                                                                                                  He creates this happy feeling by talking about his home. He talks about his simple house in which was created a cuban home. His kitchen has aromas of food filling the air. The rich skill of cooking was passed on to him. In this house he had the innocence of childhood.                                                                                                                         The second way he creates a happy mood is talking about friendship. He talked about how his land lords daughter was his friend and babysitter. This led to a playful warm tone as he lead to his grandparents who also enjoyed a meal at his house.                                                                                                                                                         The last way is talking about his neighborhood. He talked about how the immigrants in his neighborhood all helped each other. They all came to @LOCATION1 hardworking and willing. The author also wrote that family doesn't need blood.                                                                                                                                                                        Those are the ways that the author created a happy mood in the memoir The mood that was creatied by the author was a warm feeling because the text describe pride and gratefullness. Also it give a @CAPS1 and sense of a good family relationship. The author also puts feeling into his writting. Those are the feeling dat the author describes. After reading the selection \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by @PERSON1 I have decided the as a child @PERSON1 seemed to have a very fun life. Also the memoir seemed to have a good mood to it. One thing that made the mood good with all the talking about parties. I like parties and thinking about parties during @CAPS1 makes it a little less @CAPS2 racking. Another thing that sets a good mood is a talk about how Narciso's parents are always upbeat and ready for any thing. The final thing that makes the selection have a very good mood is how Narciso talks about all his family and friends. When I think of good memories of my family and friends it always brings a smile to my face. Overall this memoir made me feel good and brightened my day. The mood set by the author is thankful. The author says that he is happy to have his parents. He thanks them for giving him a life in @LOCATION1, but still carrying out their Cuban ways. He was happy to have others come into his apartment and sit down and act like family. He likes that his parents are selfless and that they care about others. He also enjoyed learning to cook, which he says he adores it to this day. The mood the author created in the memoir is... to show how to be grateful. Appreciate what you have in life. Like in the memoir Narciso lives in a apartment with one bed room. But he loved it there was and is good memories. Narciso quotes on @CAPS1 @NUM1.... \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thank them repedatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon, me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are.                                                                                                                                                                                           That quote told every thing the whole mood of the story and the very last sentence                                                      \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Narciso Rodriguez tried to create a warm feeling in your heart, remembering all of the pleasant childhood memories, and to think about all the sacrifices our parents made, to try to give us a good life. \"They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers,\"said @CAPS1 while trying to explain how parents only want to give their children a good life. There were several different moods created by the author some were @CAPS1 peacful. Like he was talking about his first @CAPS2 warmth of the kitchen cuban the feast. The mood of courage of his parents moving to the united States. Hes admiration strenth and perseverance for his parents. The faith the struggle hard times.  The mood in this memoir is caring, happy, and loving. First, it is caring. For example @PERSON1 would do anything for his family. If @PERSON1 did not do anything for his loved ones he would not care for them. Second, it is happy. For example @PERSON1 has a baby sitter and his first friend. Lastly, it is loveing. An example is when he talks about his parents. He is very greatful when he talks about his parents and the mood describes that by makeing the home feel loved. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home The Blueprints of Our Lives the author has a very appreciative mood. One example of this is when he says, \"(and for which I am an enternally grateful)\" this shows that he is incredible thankful to his parents for everything they have done for him. A second example is, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 the author saying that you can see how much gratitude he has for his parents for everything they have done for him. Lastly, he says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" This tell us that the author truly understand what her parents did for her. That is the mood in the memoir. In \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author is grateful.

He also states that he loves his house in paragraph @NUM2. \"It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays\". The mood created by the author is grateful in \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. Based on the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives by: Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 designer. The mood created by the author in memoir is happy.

The author tells about how her family would always come over to her house and have dinner there. He/@CAPS2 also tells about how their was always cuban music and cuban food. They used to have fun at that house. That's how you can tell that the mood is happy. In the short story of @PERSON1, there is a very happy mood. The story has a lot of examples of how his family was so nice. He says how his parents made their house a home, and how they put a lot of their Cuban heritage into the house. The story says that he was incredibly greatful to have parents that gave him so much love and sacrafice. The mood in the story is deffinetly a very happy one.

In the story \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, it patrays the mood of Narciso home and relationship with his parents. The mood created by the author in the story is alive, hopeful and cultural. Narciso said that his parents created a traditional Cuban home alive with Cuban food and music. Thats stating the mood was very cultural. Throughout the story it was hopefull they left Cuba and only lived in a @NUM1 room apartment but his parents were hopeful they would succeed. It was also very alive they always had someone other than their family at the table had doors open to family and friends. The Cuban music and food aroma drifted through the small place. Narciso Rodriguez will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home. The author creates a sense of unity and happiness when she explaining how she had grown in her home, her neighborhood, and with her parents. Narciso first begins to tell us about where she grew up and how she was brought. She says that she was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. She also says that she had lived in a traditional Cuban home and how she is thankful for her Cuban roots. Then Narciso continues by telling us about how there was a great sense of unity and \"family\" growing where she did. She says she grew in a neighborhood where everyone was one big family. Towards the end Narciso tells us how much she is greatful for her parents and their love & sacrifice. Throughout the whole memoir, Narciso's main focus is how she grew, her Cuban roots, her gratefulness for her her parents, and last of all her own definition of a real \"family\". I think the mood the author created in the memoir is love. Through the memoir, he talks about his parents immigrating, his new home, and people that were always at his house. This shows their love, and his parents' selflessness. He portrayed his parents as caring people and it seems like they showed love to everyone. Rodriguez says \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family.\" They seemed to put other people before themselves, and to always surround themselves with people who they love, and to love them. In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the author was feeling grateful and homesick. Narciso explains that he is grateful for his parents and what they did for him. \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their own culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today\" The mood created by the author in this memoir is being thankful. Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for his parents giving him a loving home in @LOCATION1. The author created a mood that the reader should be thankful for their parents. The sacrifice and love of anyones parents (like Rodriguez's) is what you should be most thankful for. In the memoir \"@PERSON1\" by @PERSON2, the mood is friendly. Anybody was allowed to stay at his house. \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" His parents were ready to take anyone in because they knew they also would. Their community had a strong bond. \"It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.\" @CAPS1 in the neighborhood cared for each other even if they were a different race. Getting together all the time was life in his house. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. Getting with family and celebrating was the theme of their home. @CAPS1 loved and cared for each other in the neighborhood. The mood created by the author of the memoir is a mellow, unintense and subdued almost sad mood emphesized by the hardships the Rodriguez family (parents) faced in their struggle to give their children a better life. Although slightly depressing, the mood is happy and in a way, cheerful when the author describes how kind and welcoming the Rodriguez family is in paragraph four. But, the memoir create the depressing mood in paragraph @NUM1 due to the explinations of the families struggles in moving to @LOCATION1 and what they had to give up in order to selflessely better their childrens life.Over all, between the cheerful mood of the memoir and the sad mood of the memoir, the memoir generates a mellow, calm and serene mood throughout the article. The @CAPS1 Created @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 in this story is A very strong And happy @CAPS4 @CAPS5 They @CAPS6 From Cuba to A @CAPS7 @CAPS8 the United States And They were hoping For A Better life For there kids then The life that they had And @CAPS9 why the @CAPS1 was happy. In the memoirs of Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the writing is grateful. The two main examples of what Narciso is grateful for are his heritage and his family. Narciso is very grateful for his heritage and is a proud cuban. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 he talks about how he loves cuban food, cooking, and music and how he is grateful for all of them. Another thing that Narciso is extremely grateful for is his family. His family moved up to @LOCATION1 before he was born so that their children could have a better life. They have sacrificed so much for their children including social and financial sacrifices. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso writes, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" Any sane human being would be grateful to have parents that did what Narciso's parents did for him. As now evident, the main focus and mood of this excerpt from @PERSON1 memoirs is that he is grateful. In the memoir from \"Home: The blueprints of our lives\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of this seems to be overjoyed, and happy. His life so far in @LOCATION1 must be great. For example, Narciso talked about how his sense of \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Also, about passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. As well as the love and sacrifice of his parents that was given to give him a better life. But most of all the mood gets serious at times, like when he talked about how his parents turned the simple house he lived in into a home. Then, how it was in @LOCATION1 he learned the real definition of the word \"family\", and how to love, etc. In conclusion, the memoir jumped from overjoyed and happy into very serious and real. In the @CAPS1 by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso seems to get a certin mood, tward his parents, a mood of happyness and greatfullness.Thorought the hole @CAPS1 Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for everything they have done, and gave up just for him to have a better life. His parents gave up their Jobs, thier houses, they left ther family there, thier friends, and in return they go to @CAPS2 and give thier son a better life, witch he is constantly saying how greatfull, and how honored he is to have parents who will give up everything they had for him Over All thorought The @CAPS1 @PERSON1 sets a mood of happiness, and gratfull ness tward his loving parents. The mood in the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is happy and sympathetic. One reason is they never gave up no matter how hard it was. Narciso said that his parents, \"drove them to endure these hard times,\" so, no matter how hard the times are they never gave up. Another reason is they stayed very close with their family. The author wrote, \"all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table, \"this shows that their whole family was very close to each other. My final reason is that the Rodriguez's always wanted to help. Narciso said, \"My parents always kept their arms and their doors open,\" which shows that they always wanted to help people in need. The mood in the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez,\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is happy and sympathetic. The mood in the memoir is gratefulness and happiness. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.\" This shows how @CAPS1 thanks his parents for loving cooking. Skill that cooking and his eternal gratitude. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 it says \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 is happy that @CAPS1 grew up in @LOCATION1 and how grateful @CAPS1 is to them for passing down their traits and loves to him and all their hard work. The author created a heartfelt mood in the memoir. The mood the author created was greatful mood. In the memoir it states \"skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)\" This quote make me feel grateful for my culture and heritage. This story also make me feel proud. In the story it states \"My Mother and father had come to this country with such courage\". I feel so proud that they wanted to leave to come have a better life. Lastly the mood is happy. This story is happy because he learns a good lesson and he pround of his parents and culture. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a combonation of calm, nice, and happy. It could also be described as heavenly.Narciso reffers to his childhood like it was one happy dream. \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and the endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home\". He also mentions how greatful he is to his parents. \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\". One last fact that contributes to the mood of this memoir, is Narciso's view on family. \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship\".From this excerpt it is clear that the author cherish this time, and would love to go back. The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates is gratefullness. When I read this, I feel thankful like the author. Although his family had a good life in Cuba, they left to give their kids a better life. @CAPS1 the author's family hadn't left Cuba, I think the mood would be different. Then the author wouldn't think his parents were selfless (for that reason, anyway) @CAPS1 my parents did that for my siblings and me, I would want people to feel grateful as well. @PERSON1 understands how hard it was for his parents. Another mood could be guilt. I feel guilty when I read this because I don't always thank my parents or apreciate them. Narciso Rodriguez created a lot of moods in the memoir. In the memoir, the mood, or how the article made me feel, was grateful.Narciso Rodriguez wrote this memoir almost as a thank you letter.\"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. -paragraph @NUM1 uses words that portait the mood of thankfullness, like \"eternaly grateful\" in paragraph @NUM2, or \"I will always be gratefull\" in paragraph @NUM3.Narciso Rodriguez describes all of the sacrifices that were made and all the hardships lived through by his parents. He describes their coming to @LOCATION1 selflessly and beginning anew all so that their children could life -paragraph @NUM4.When I read this memoir, it reminded me of all of the things my parents have done so that I @MONTH1 be happy- so that I can have a home. The mood created by @PERSON1, the author of the memoir, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a comforting one. This is shown, for instance, by his reccolection of his childhood in his family's home being fond. For example, he states that he is \"eternally grateful\" for his parents passing on, \"their rich culinary skills and love of cooking\" that he claims to still have. Also, he remembers life as being neighborly and treating neighbors and friends as part of their family with kindness and sharing. This is shown when Narciso says, \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" In addition the comforting feeling is shown when Narciso says, \"I learned here about how to love.... My parents turned this simple house into a home. This shows that Narciso had a great place to grown up in and has fond and comforting memories of it. The mood created by the author in the memoir is humble. He loves him home alot. He loves the scent and the music and culture in his house. In the memoir he stated that \"Passionate cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. The mood in the memoir is also touching. He say that his mom is so helping and opening to family members in need. He had stated that \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family.\" @CAPS1 example of mood from the memoir is how he explains how close his community is. He states that all the cultures and ethicitys came together in great friend. The mood the author created in the memoir is touching, humble and inspiring. In the memoir by @PERSON1 the mood in the memoir by grateful, friendship. The first @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 Narciso was very grateful cooking that is still with me today (And for which I am @CAPS2 grateful that means that Narciso like these there cooking and it very grateful.The @ORGANIZATION1 shows that Narciso is very friendship with his Parents and friendship \"All of these cultures came together as a family in the memeior by @PERSON1 the two @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3 How Narciso @CAPS4 grateful and friendship.  In the nonfiction memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author created a warm, busy, and giving mood. The mood is warm because in the memoir it says \"the congregation of family and friends and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home\". This shows she were a lot of friends and family together in this home showing friends and family being together. Also the mood is busy because in the memoir it says \"countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporaily until they were able to get back on their feet\". This shows how people were always coming and going in this home. The mood was also giving. It was giving because in the memoir it says \"It was close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people, who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need\". This shows how people were given when othrs needed help even if they were not the same kind. That is the mood the author gave in this memoir. The authors mood of the memoir is that @CAPS1 is grateful because @CAPS1 tells us how much @CAPS1 appreciates of what his parents have done. @CAPS1 appreciates that his parents \"immigrated\" to the United States so @CAPS1 can have a \"better life\". @CAPS1 said that \"they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country the loved.\" @CAPS1 is grateful that his parents did that for him. @CAPS1 is happy that his parents made their house like if they were in Cuba where they originally came from. @CAPS1 said that the \"Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.\" @CAPS1 is thankful of the \"sacrifice\" that his parents needed to make. @CAPS1 is so grateful that @CAPS1 can't \"express his gratitude\". The author thanks his parents of what they've done to make him happy. That is how grateful the author is towards what his parents did to make them have a better life and @CAPS1 has learned what the word \"family\" truly means. The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez is very happy and uplifting. The whole story is an optimistic view of Narciso's child hood. None of the bad parts of his childhood are written about. He writes about his perent's coming from Cuba and how some of his family would come and eat with them. Narciso's memoir is a happy look back at his child hood.Narciso is very grateful for his family, specifically his parents. They came from Cuba to @LOCATION1 to start a good life for their son. This causes the beginning this memoir to start off with a happy, uplifting mood. As the memoir progresses, it still maintains the same happy mood. Paragraph @NUM1 is a great example of how the mood created by the author is so happy. Paragraph @NUM1 talks about how Narciso's family would go to their house and share meals with them. Narciso was happy to be around his family. The best example of the mood created by Narciso is the final @NUM3 paragraph. Paragraph @NUM4 talks about Narciso's gratitude towards his parents. He loves them so much for coming to @LOCATION1 and leaving their promising jobs in Cuba to give Narciso a better life. The final paragraph talks about how Narciso's whole family a house into a home. This is a very happy paragraph to complete the happy mood of the story.The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is extremely happy. There are no mad, or sad parts of his child hood mentioned in the memoir. In the article Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood in this story is very happy, and heart warming. When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how the sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. It makes the mood happy. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood in \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives.\" The mood of this memoir could be described as nostalgic or even love to some extent (as in loving his old home, family, friends, ect.) The author mentions \"endless celebrations ... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" This helps create the mood because the author is reminicing on the events that happened in his home (in this case, they were very happy memories) The author mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that during a time of racism in the @CAPS1 his community was so close-knit that people were like family. He even states: \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" These examples from the memoir help create a nostalgic mood, it also shows the love throughout the community. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 the author says he \"will never forget\" the things he \"learned there about how to love.\" Which builds on these two themes as well (due to the fact he is remembering the feeling of love he expirienced and learned.) In conclusion, the mood(s) of this story would be of nostalgic and/or love. In the passage the author provided a good mood. for example he talked a lot about love, friendship, and other related things. He talked about the differences of a home and house. He made this passage for people to start thinking about what love realy is and what people will realy do for each other. He is a very good author. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\", an internationally recognized clothing designer, offers the following definition of \"family\". In this memoir the mood set by Narciso Rodriguez is a gratefull person of his rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with him today. He is also grateful to his parent for their love and sacrafice, it wasn't for their love and sacafrice to come to the @CAPS1.S he would not be who he is now in days. That's why his a grateful person. The mood created by the author in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez is caring, loving, happiness, and being grateful.                                           These moods are all created because Narciso loves his parents and his home. Also, his culture.Narciso has a mood that is caring because he cares about his home and his parents. He is also happy to have a loving home and parents who love and care about him. Narciso is grateful for his loving home and his loving parents.The author created these moods because they are specific memoirs of his life and he feels all of these moods for the house that he has and for the parents that he loves. Narciso feels all these moods, and he will \"never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home.\" In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez the author create the mood of familarty and homyness.First, in the memoir Narciso describes his home enough to give the reader a sense of homyness. There are many examples of this in the memoire. One is when Narciso Rodriguez says \"the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home.\" When Narciso writes this it creates a sense of home or homyness. This is one of the many moods Narciso makes you feel in the passageSeconde, Narciso also creates a mood of, famileraty to a lot of people. Espesically immigrents, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life.\" This is something all immigrants and sons of immigrents know of. So Narciso creats a mood of familerty with this memoir.Finally, in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, their is a mood of homyness and famlierty. In the story Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created. For example, one mood is love. @CAPS1 family did everything for love. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" This quote shows @CAPS1 family took care of everyone even thought they did not have much themselves.Another example of mood is being together Narciso's family helped out all imagrants to get back on their feet. Paragraph @NUM2 says, \"they came selflessly, as many imagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" Narciso's family helped the less fortunate very often. The mood of this story is very inviting and peaceful. In the memoir written by @PERSON1, he tells about how his parents immigrated from Cuba to The United States so that he could have a better life. He tells of how he will always be grateful for his Cuban culture that stayed with him his whole life, and for the selflessness of his parents. The mood that he sets in this memoir is gratefulness. When his parents moved from Cuba, they had his best interest in mind. This memoir also tells that economically, they struggled. However, @PERSON1's family still found away to have a home. They created a bond with the people in the area and stayed very close with them. This gave @CAPS1 a sense of family even though his real family was very far away. He is grateful for this because he will always have his cuban culture because that's what he was raised with. The overall mood he created was gratefulness. In the excerpt, the author created a relaxed tone in the memoir. \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen\". This shows how equipped his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez child hood and life. \"Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\". This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author. I think the mood created by the author was very warm, greatful and happy. I think this because he often expresses how his parents sacrificed a lot of things and made his childhood ful of joyous memories. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" In many paragraphs he explains how he admires them for their strength and perseverance in moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. I also said happy because he is happy that his childhood was so memorable. \"Innocence of childhood... endless celebrations.\" This shows me that he enjoyed the parties and being a kid. (growing up in that household.) This is why I think the mood is so grateful and happy. The mood created by the author overall is gratefulness. As Narciso writes about some events in his life you notice he mostly talks about his family. He says that you don't have to be a blood relative to be family, what matters is love.Narciso is mostly grateful to his parents who sacraficed their old lives in Cuba for him to have a better life in the US. Their jobs in Cuba were great but when they got to @LOCATION1 they had to have whatever job they could get.Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love he learned the real definition of family. It saw what courage it took for his parents to turn the simple house they once had into a home for him. IN THE MEMOIR HOME: THE BLUEPRINTS OF OUR LIVES. HER MOOD IS LOVE, BECAUSE SHE LOVES HER PARENTS FOR ALL THE SACRIFICES THEY MADE, JUST SO NARCISCO CAN HAVE A BETTER LIFE FOR EXAMPLE, \"I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL TO MY PARENTS FOR THEIR LOVE AND SACRIFICE.\" SHE MEANS SHE WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT HER PARENTS DONE FOR HER IN HER CHILDHOOD TO MAKE HER BECOME WHAT SHE IS NOW. ANOTHER EXAMPLE, \"I WILL NEVER FORGET HOW MY PARENTS TURNED THIS SIMPLE HOUSE INTO A HOME.\" SHE MEANS THAT HER PARENTS SACRIFICED TO TURN A @NUM1 ROOM APARTMENT INTO HER HOME. Narciso Rodriguez set a strong mood of happieness and thankfullness in his memoir. One way he did this is by thanking his parents for passing on their culinary skills to him. He says in the memoir that he is \"eternally grateful\" and still has a love of cooking. Another way he set this mood was by explaining how nice his neighborhood was. He said that all the different cultures came together in solidarity and friendship and everyone was hardworking. A third way he did this was by saying how great his parents were. He said he was greatful for their love and sacrifice. their strength and perseverance, and their courageousness. Narciso Rodriguez said a happy and thankful mood in his memoir. In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The author sets a very greatful & loving tone. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso states \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice.\" Narciso's parents left everything they ever had behind, to make his life easier. This whole excerpt is thanking them. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso ends with \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" This quote shows how much he loves them. He could've had a big house where his family lived, but it wouldn't be home. Instead, he had a small house where everybody shared things. He could really call it home.In the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez the author sets the tone of gretfulness & loving. I can relate to this story because it reminds me of my family. In the memoir from \"Home: Blueprints of our lives\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author stretches the importance of family. The mood that Narciso Rodriguez creates is a comfortable, loving, homey feeling. He states that he grows up learning that \"family has nothing to do with being a blood relative\". He says that his family welcomed everybody. Strangers that needed help, neighbors, and extended family. He creates a loving mood when he said he lived in a \"close-knit community\". He also says \"These cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" @CAPS1, when @PERSON2 says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,\" you can sense his appreciation and feel the comforting atmosphere. Those were the moods I felt while reading this memoir by, Narciso Rodriguez. In the memor from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez his mood is very meaning full. You can tell that what he's saying he really means it, he's senser. He say's \"my parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen\" in paragraph @NUM1 line @NUM2. In paragraph @NUM2 line @NUM4 he say's \"it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immgrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Or when he tells us that his first friend was his babysitter @PERSON2 who was his land lords daughter. Narciso Rodriguez tells us how his parents \"always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. in paragraph @NUM5 line @NUM6. He tells us in paragraph @NUM7 second line how his mother and father \"came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life\" even if it did mean leaving behind their loved ones, and things they loved. In the last sentence of his memor he says \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\"With those last words you from Narciso Rodriguez you know that he is senser, about what he's saying and that he could never thank his parents for what they did for him. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very satisfactory mood. The author uses a satisfactory tone, too, especially when the author is explaining what a family is. Near the end of the memoir it has a very satisfactory mood, partly because it is near the end and they are ending the memoir, and also it is explaining what a family is. The mood of the memoir is also interesting because the author uses information of Narciso Rodriguez's life to help explain what a family is. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very satisfactory and interesting. In this memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez by The blue prints of Our Lives, the author sets a deep and powerful mood to the setting. Throught this memoir we feel happy as he explains his culture, for example as it states in paragraph (@NUM1) \"Here the innocense of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home's.\" @CAPS1 the author uses warm words that fill our heart's. For example in paragraph (@NUM2) it state's \"But in reality there is no way to express my grattitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age. And @CAPS2 this author uses @CAPS3 to use further information which explains Narciso's feeling towards certain childhood memories. Such as the cuban culture. These are three examples of how the author sets the mood in this memoir. The mood created by the author in this memoir is gratitude and great memories. Narcisco is obviously grateful towards his parents for teaching him how to love and that family or friends come first. Narcisco is talking a lot in this memoir about his great family memories of all his friends and family coming over for dinner and his mother cooking in the kitchen traditional Cuban food while listening to traditional Cuban music. He learned that friends and family members are there to love and spend time with. The tone of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was a happy one with many positive feelings, memories, and undertones mixed in. Rodriguez sets the mood in the @NUM1 paragraph when @CAPS2 describes the warm, inviting, and cozy feeling that was given off at his home. Here @CAPS2 describes how \"passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" This gives off a warm, innocent vibe, staging the mood for the memoir @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM2, the mood is expanded so that it also encopasses the welcoming feel of the house. Here, Rodriguez says that his \"parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people [they] considered family\". Finally, this excerpt gives off a proud and graceful mood. This pride and gratitude from Narciso Rodriguez is directed toward his parents @CAPS2 uses many words like \"courage\", \"selflessly\", \"struggled\", \"braving\", and \"hardships\" to describe Rawedia and @PERSON2's actions with a proud undertone Rodriguez then talks about how grateful @CAPS2 is to his parents \"for their love and sacrifice\" (paragraph @NUM3). Then @CAPS2 goes on to talk about how deeply grateful @CAPS2 is towards his parents for all they did for him in great detail. The mood of this memoir is happy, welcoming, warm, grateful, and proud. that would make anyone yearn for the one place where they too felt this feeling circulating around them The mood created by the author was a very loving mood. Rodriguez describes his home life as @CAPS1 grew up in Newark, New Jersey. @CAPS1 describes the Cuban heritage that his parents based their home upon, including the music and the aroma, and \"endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 grew up with a \"sense\" of family. His neighborhood was different than much of @LOCATION2 because \"all of these cultures [Spanish, Cuban, Italian] came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" @CAPS1 expressed the love his parents had by explaining their hard work as they experience financial and personal struggles. \"@CAPS1 says @CAPS1 learned the real definition of family through his parents, and is very grateful. \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" The mood of this story is happy he paints a picture with words in the @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3 + @CAPS1 and he tells of the extreme unity and happiness of his house hold neiborhood and family. He also shows how happy he is and how grateful he is of his Parents.He paints a picture with words in the @NUM1, @NUM2, @NUM3 @CAPS1 he says My parents where originally from Cuba, And the came here and I was born in a simple house in Jersey. In my house there was beatiful Cuban music and cooking going on we always had family over and neiborgs he paints an nice soothing picture.In the story he also talks about the unity of his neicboorhood made up of mostly spanish immagrints. He talks about that in @CAPS1 @NUM3, @NUM8. This shows you how happy he was.In many places in the story he also says how grate ful he is to his parents and how much courage the had to do the trip.As you can see the mood in this tory is grate ful and happy. The mood of the memoir is pleasent. @PERSON1 talks about her nice childhood. She talks about selfless her parents are to her. Also the mood is set when @PERSON1's is parents help other people get back on their feet. Also talking about how people would eat dinner with @PERSON1's family. She also tells about how she had family that weren't exactly blood relatives but, they were people who cared for each other like a family. Also the way Narciso told was with a very pleasant tone. The mood Created by the author is @CAPS1. I @CAPS5 this because you can tell that the narrator doesn't take anything for granted. I know this because the @CAPS2 parents was given a house, and since @CAPS8 was part of the family, it was her duty to make that house a home as much as possible with her parents. I Know this because it @CAPS7 it in @CAPS3 @NUM1, and @NUM2.The author also gives a @CAPS4 mood in this memoir. I @CAPS5 this because in @CAPS3 @NUM1, and @NUM4 it @CAPS7 that @CAPS8 is Cuban and italian, from Newark, New Jersey, and @CAPS8 seems to be @CAPS4 of who @CAPS8 is and where @CAPS12 from. I know all of this is true because its all in the text. In the story, Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a certain mood after @CAPS1 describes the hardships his family faced to give him a better life.\"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved.\" @CAPS1 feels thankful of what @CAPS1 has and appreciates what his parents did for him. This sets an happy mood because @CAPS1 is happy of what @CAPS1 has and wouldn't give anything to replace it.In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso Rodriguez sets a nostalgic mood because @CAPS1 is talking about his childhood and the past with his family back then. @CAPS1 also explains that \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family.\" This creates a warm and friendly mood, by knowing that his parents were friendly and generous.The story Narciso Rodriguez sets many moods on the reader. According to the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author created a mood throughout the memoir. The mood was happiness because Narciso was happy with his life.One example of Narciso's happiness is with his home. When @CAPS1's telling about the apartment @CAPS1 grow up in the mood is happy. Although it wasn't much his parents made him comfortable in it. They made it seem like Cuba as much as they could. Narciso loved his apartment even if it wasn't Cuba. In paragraph two \"within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home.\" @CAPS1 was happy with the apartment because his parents made it feel like a Cuban home to him.Another example of Narciso's happiness is with his family. Narciso tells how his friends seem like family. In paragraph four \"Our landlord and his daughter... do the same for us.\" Even though the people aren't blood related to him @CAPS1's still happy with them. Finally, based on the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives the author created a happy mood. This mood was created because Narciso is happy with the life @CAPS1 lives. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez From Home: The blueprints of our lives the author sets a sad mood in this memoir. An example of the sad mood set the author describes his neighborhood. The author describes his neighbor hood by saying \"our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, cuban and Italian immigrants.\" (@NUM1) This show they live in a run down neighborhood because most immigrants are poor when they arrived at the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 example is when he describes his family. The author say's \"There was often someone staying with us temporarly until they were able to get back on their feet\". (@NUM2) This shows the poverty that they lived around because they had to put shelter around those who couldn't aford it. The last way the author describes the sacrifice of his parents, The author say's \"The Faith that this would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times\". (@NUM3) This is a sad mood because it shows how their @CAPS2 back fired and they didn't have a very happy time. That is why I think the tone of this memoir is a sad one. The mood that the author created in the memior is love and friendship. In the memoir they talk about family and how the love each other. Another mood mood that the author creates is happiness. The memior is uplifting and cheerful. Those are two of the moods the author rreates. Based on the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is peaceful because the whole memoir is talking about love and care for each other and your family.In this memoir there are many times where the author discusses his love for cooking. \"It was the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent in music but life in love\". This quote shows that Cuban feasts caused him to experience life and love with his family and loved ones. \"It was here where I learned the real definition of family\". This proves that his life in New Jersey at his house helped him realize the true meaning of family. The last quote that made this memoir peaceful was when he said, \"And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood where the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\". This quote shows the love and affection that Narciso Rodriguez feels about his parents and his home.After reading this memoir, that was the mood that was created by the author in this memoir. The mood created by narciso Rodriguez was appreciation, or that's what I got out of it. Throughout the whole memoir, narciso's affectionate language and explanation to his life and his parents was constant and grasping. In paragraph two, he uses perenthesis as if his gratitude is so strong, that he can't bear to leave out how thankful he is. He set the scene with new experience and inspiration, Which he always thanked his parents for introducing him to. \"I will always be grataful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them What they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done...\"p. @NUM1. He closed it off with how he could never forget how his parents turned a house into a home, appreciation flowing strongly The author creates a mood of joy and thankfulness in the memoir of how great life was and how grateful he is for what was given to him. The author writes about how even with the little they had how happy his house was with all the music and visitors that were mentioned in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Also the author portrays how thankful and grateful he is for everything he was taught, was sacrificed for him, and for the life lessons that were instilled in him. In paragraph @NUM3, the author writes how he learned that \"family\" wasn't only blood relatives but was all your friends that would always be there for you as you would be for them. The author also explains how grateful he is for everything his parents went through for him in paragraphs @NUM4 and @NUM5 giving mood of happiness and grateful ness. Narciso also creates a mood of love, as of that he had for his parents and \"family\" that he says transferred his house into a home in paragraph @NUM6. The author creates a very warm mood and inviting mood that makes you want to feel relaxed and comfortable. Here are the ways he creates it. He describes the kitchen and how his family loves to cook and entertain. He says that his parents have welcomed refugees to stay at the house that sets a welcomeing mood and that the parents care for their friends and family. To his family the word \"family\" means anyone it's important to remember that because a family could be anyone. That's how the author sets the mood. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and warm. The author talks about how grateful Narciso Rodriguez is. Narciso also loves the home he grew up in. He also talks about all the people that live near him and how he loves them all like family. His parents are very good cooks, and they taught Narciso their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today. His mood is very loving and caring, and its his family and how he adores them that is the mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood in this memoir was very happy and grateful to be living in the house where Narciso had such good neighbors as family, who were close to him. Even though Narciso's neighbors weren't actually family (as in blood related) Narciso still felt comfortable with them as if they really were his family. \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" @CAPS1 on their street the immagrents were like a family. They all carried for each other and were happy. A wonderful mood was created by Narciso Rodriguez, the author, in this memoir. While reading this story, I could feel the love, peace, & appreciation created by his words. Throughout the memoir, he really expands on the love & appreciation he feels for his parents. Paragraph @NUM1 states: \"I'll always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice.\" Also, in paragraph @NUM2, he again mentions his parents & how they had turned a house into a home. You can feel his awe & appreciation spilling out of his words. Also, the childhood home is described in paragraph @NUM3. Rodriguez describes the house's feeling as warm & elaborates on the things he's grateful to and will always love. The mood of this memoir is very specifically felt. The mood created by the author in the memoir is made up of happeness, love, and lastly respect for his parents, whitch shows how the mood is actually peaceful. In the memoir the author stated memeries of his neighborhood that was good. The authors stated about how the cultures formed together, helped each other and worked hard to make a living as well is a future for their kids, which shows his respect for his friends and family. The author states his gratitude toward the hard ships his parents went through for him and for the dream of a better tomorrow. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness, unity, and caring. \"The congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to life in our warm house.\" The author shows that he likes his house and enjoys how it is, \"family had nothing to do with being blood relative. saying that all can be family as long as you care about each other.\" Close-knit community\"shows unity. \"@CAPS1 get families get back on their feet.\" shows caring. she enjoyed doing this It made her happy. That is how the author in the memoir made the mood of happiness, unity, and caring. The mood created by the author of the excurpt \"Narciso Rodriguez\" From Home: The Blueprints of our Lives in the memoir was love, happiness, and old memories of home. In paragraph seven it states \"... i celebrated my first birthdays. it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house...\" That shows how much he loved his home, even though it wasn't purfect. Also in paragraph four he say's \"..our landlords and his daughter Alegria-my first friend...\" Narciso's tell's about his first friend. But the tone that gives the best mood of the story is the memorie that Narciso's say's \"... i will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home...\". In paragraph seven. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy thankful mood. The why it is a happy thankful mood is for the reason why he talk's about his family and how they sacraficed so much just for him. For example; \"They came selflessly, as many immigrant's do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country the loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardship.\" @CAPS1 thing is that he also learned what family really means. For example; \"I learned the real definition of \"family\". And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many thing's I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parent's turned this simple house into a home.\" In the story, \"Narciso Rodriguez,\" the narrator had shown happiness throughout the memoir.One example of when the author showed happiness was when they were thinking about cooking. They admired when their parents helped and teached them how to cook. They would hear the music in the back that they adored as their heritage or backround. In the story it says, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking.\"When the authors still live with their parents their relatives would come over to eat and have fun. To reflect back on those memories made the author happy. In the story it says, \"Countless extended family members came and went-- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back upon their feet.\"@CAPS1 example is when the author thought of the time when their parents moved to @LOCATION1. They thought of how lucky their parents were to come to such a nice place. In the story it says, \"they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very thankful. Again and again @CAPS1 thanks his parents for several of the things that they gave to him that @CAPS1 still values. First, @CAPS1 thanks them for passing on their love of cooking and music which @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 is \"externally greatful\" for and which @CAPS1, \"adores to this day.\" @CAPS1 is thankful for how they brought him up, showing this by writing how much @CAPS1 still enjoys these things today. Next, Narciso Rodriguez says how @CAPS1, \"will always be gratful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 describes how they did so much to give their child a better life. They sacrificed their laboratory and chemical engineering jobs to work their way up from the very bottom in @LOCATION1 to give their children more opportunity. His parents left behind, \"their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.\" @CAPS3, they did all of this with, \"The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times.\" The parents sacrificed so much because they wanted so badly for their children to have a good life and for this Narciso Rodriguez is extremely greatful. The mood created by the author in the memoir was decribed passionately and emotionally. The mood in this whole memoir was gratefullness. starting from the beginning how his family passed on their traditions. Also having people around him family and friends who helped him, living close in reach. With his parents giving up everything from their past just to start a family with a better life. sacrificing all they had in life. His life was filled with joy and happiness, thanks to his family and friends. The mood created by the author in the memoir is courage. \"I will always be greatful to my parent for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Another example of courage is how \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in a country they loved. This is the mood the author creates in this memoir. In the story The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez the @CAPS1 creats a mood, here is the mood created. The first mood is the one of her house. She describes friends and family with cuban music along with the food here is one example of the food and music \"Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Another mood is the family and friends. An example of this is in paragraph four where it says \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family.\" And those are some reasons how the @CAPS1 set a mood in The Blueprints of our lives. The mood created by the author in the memoir is a positive one. The author tells how his parents immigrated from Cuba in 1956 and how he was born in 1961. He never said one negative thing about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey. He mentioned how his parents had a love for cooking and that love was passed down to him. He said that he was grateful for that. He also mentioned that, along with the cooking, was Passionate Cuban music. He described his neighborhood as being made up of \"all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" As a final sentence, the author stated how we \"will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood -- feeling, rather -- of belonging, \"home\", and comfort. He recalls growing up in an apartment where \"countless extended family members came and went\" and his life was full of people from his community -- cousins, aunts, friends. Narciso recalls that his parents \"always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family\" -- and there is a sense of belonging. Comfort: \"the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\"There's also a sense of thanks in this -- gratefulness, one could say. Narciso's parents left everything behind when they immigrated to @LOCATION1 from Cuba -- and as he says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" And this -- all of this -- creates the sense of \"home\". The mood created by the author in this memoir is gratitude Narciso Rodriguez, the author is grateful for the way his cuban parents brought him up when they had so little to begin with @CAPS1 thing that the author is grateful for are the cuban traditions that his family passed on to him. One of the traditions would be there rich culinary skills and a love of cooking. @CAPS1 thing the author is grateful for is that his mother and father came to this country to give him a better life even though it meant leaving behind, family, friends, careers and the country they loved That was the mood created by the author in this memoir. The mood is shown and explained in several ways throughout the memoir. The mood of this short story is happiness and of a sense of family. The first example of this mood is in paragraph @NUM1 when the @CAPS1 says \"growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" @PERSON1 is showing that just because someone is not related to another person they cannot be family. Another example of the mood of the excerpt is when is when Narciso says \"My parents always kept to their arms and door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us.\" The @CAPS1 is showing that people who love each other like family have each other's backs, no matter what. A final example is when the @CAPS1 states \"I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned about how to love.\" The @CAPS1 is saying he is greatful for the people who showed him what \"family\" really is. In closing this story shows true family and how a house becomes a home. In this memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from \"Home: The @CAPS1 of our Lives\" it tells us about a kid from Cuba.This memoir has a positive mood. It says that they keep family or friends in their home untill they get back on their feet. It tells us about the neighborhood he live in. And how theres many different types of immigrants there and how they all get along. The kid's parents have friends and family over for dinner. The parents give up everything their jobs, friend, and families so that their kid could grow up in @LOCATION1.  The mood created by the author in the memoir is a nice \"homie\" feeling. The author tries to let you know a home is more than physical walls it is a place for relationships are made. \"The congregation of family and friends.\" The is is signifagant because all of the good times an celebrations occurred with the people he loved in his home. The author tries to show the love and affection throughout his home. \"always filled the air with not just sent in music but life and love.\" The author shows the love that goes on throughout his home. The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a very happy and loving mood. As it says in the memoir \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice\". This means he is happy and loves his parents have done. It also says \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance\". He loves his parents and is happy with what they have done. The last thing the memoir says is \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\". This ment he was very thankful for what they have done. Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, has a happy and loving mood. This happy and loving mood is exspressed throughout the memoir. The mood created by the author in this memoir is the appreciation through the author's parents. Another mood is the happiness of \"home\" or family. In paragraph @NUM1, the author is grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice and courage. In the last paragraph, paragraph @NUM2, Narciso mentions how welcomed refugees that just arrived to the country were at their house to stay, that the \"warmth of this Kitchen and humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with life and love\" made her learn the definition of \"family\". In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from \"Home: The Blueprints of our lives\" the mood created by the author is that his parents were loving and caring. His parents were loving and caring because they made their house into a home. His parents were selfless and caring when they come to the United States. In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice\". This shows his parents were loving and made sacrafices for their children to have a good life. In paragraph @NUM2 it says \"they struggled both personally and financially\". This shows they cared about their family because they sacraficed things to struggle & make their family happy. In conclusion, the mood is being caring and loving. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso mood in the memoir seemed happy and grate. Narciso's mood sound happy because when he was telling us (readers) about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey and explaining how his house was he was saying how his landlord and daughter nice and how the landlord's daughter was his first friend, and he was also saying how his family and friends were very close. In the neighborhood it was despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity (happiness) and friendship. His mother and father made the house cozy and at the end of the memoir the author said \"I will never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home meaning that he never had a home like the one he lived in now. The mood in this memoir is very relaxed and proud. The author showed that he was so proud of his parents and his culture. He talked with a relaxed feeling and loving everything about his home and culture. Also the mood is so grateful. He is so grateful of his neighbors and how they all came together. Also he was grateful to have his family and friends in his apartment. The author was just so proud of his life and parents. There are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir. First, he had described his house when he had first moved in. He said that it was a simple house, situated in a two-family and it was a blonde-brick building. Second, he told us how he should be happy of what he has and to be greatful. He was saying that the word solidarity was a big word and meant something. Last, he was describing the hope that he had about his parents and home that he had. He was saying that \"which i am eternally grateful)\" also, \"which i adore to this day\". These are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir.  The mood that the author in the memoir created was good by his love, his blood relative, and also by courage.To start with her love is like part of her life. He love his parents. For example In the storie say's \"I will always be grate ful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 this mean she loves he parent for every little single thing they did. Also he learn how to love people.As will as her blood relative meaning that he @CAPS2 got to do with nothing of this. She is from cuba, and came to the united state on 1956. Also born to this a simple house. His that build a traditional home.This is how the author describe the mood, by his love, his blood relative, and also by courage. In the memoir many moods were expressed. I think the mood that was expressed the most was happiness. Narciso described to us that no matter what happened her family and close friends would always feel a sense of belonging with each other. This gave everyone mentioned in the story great reason to be happy and feel good about themselves and each other. In conclusion, the strongest mood in the story was happiness. In the story memoir the author created a couple of different mood to decribe the story.      The first mood was greatfullness. The author described greatfullness tword the parents when the author was discribing selflessness caring of the parants when they made the disision to move to @LOCATION1 to give them a better life. The last mood discribed by the author was happyness. The author discribed happiness in the story when it was discribing the parents making everyone feel at home These are the differend moods discribed in the story by the author. The mood is @CAPS1 in many ways. First, the mood in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS1 as if he was happy to immigrant to the @LOCATION1 Also its @CAPS1 as sad, \"... Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved\", another mood would be brave. For me these immigraters are brave because I would never want to leave behind my friends and especially my family. Another mood is greatful. \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" In conclution, these are many ways the mood is @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2. In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The blueprints of our lives the mood is heartfilling, and about appreciction. In the memoir @CAPS1 says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" @CAPS1 thanks his parents so much for everything they've done for him. @CAPS1 also says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" @CAPS1 knows it wasn't easy but loves how his parents managed to give him the best life possible. @CAPS1 writes, \"what they did was much more courageous then I could hae ever done.\" @CAPS1 knows his parents took chances and did whatever to keep him happy which sets this mood to be so warm and heart filling. Warmth                                                                                                                                            In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" the author created the mood in many ways.One way the author creates the mood is by saying (paragraph @NUM1) \"The very heart of which was the kitchen; passionat Cuban music filled the air. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations\". This creates a warm mood because the kitchen seems like a very friendly place due to the people gathering together.Another way the author creates the mood is by saying that \"my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us\". (paragraph @NUM2)These are the ways of the author of \"Narciso @CAPS1\" created the mood in this story. The @CAPS1 sets a good mood in this memoir about his house.the @CAPS1 states the house is a sign of life and love. The @CAPS1 states, \"always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love.\" The @CAPS1 explains the mood by a Cuban feast. Also when he learns that in the neighborhood there is love to. The @CAPS1 states, \"And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neiborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" The @CAPS1 shows how many cultures and countrys show satisfaction in the whole neiborhood that is filled with mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1. The @CAPS1 shows a good positive, and geneorus mood in the book that has all started in the kitchen with a Cuban feast. The mood I think the author created in the memoir was love.The reason why I say love is because to me he cares about the his family and he also stayed with his family tradition and he care and follows them. He also loved being with his family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 in the article it say; \"I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to LOVE. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home. and to me that shows Love thats why I think the author created Love as his mood in the memoir. The mood created by the author is loving and happy for many reasons. It is loving because Narciso really loves his family and is grateful for his parents for giving up there lives, to give him a better one, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" It is happy because the overall memoir is about family and friends and good his child hood was. \"Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Those are the biggest moods that this memoir potrays. The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and grateful because the author is grateful of his parents for having a roof over his head, cooking food for him, and for having such courageous parents. That's the mood of the author in the memoir. The mood created in this memoir was manily for me family and Love. for most of the memoir the author was talking about exprens he had in the house, and the love he had's for his family and frend's. The first example I have for the mood is when he say's \"as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\". This shows the parents love for the kids. a second example I have is for family when the reading say's \"growing up in this environment instilled in me a great senst that \"family\". and he is talking about thy are all so close nit. This reading was a good example of a closs nit comunity and of parent scracise. for they kid's. The mood in the author's story is happy and gratefull. Happy because even though it was a new country the came with a purpose and are living it with their culture which is past down family to family. \"My mother and father came to this country with such couage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends and careers in the country they loved.\" Also greatfull because he sees what his parents did and does for him so he could be happy. \"I will always be gratefull to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" \"I was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love!\" The mood created by the author in the memoir is proud. The author was proud because he was growing up as a loving caring child in the US. Also he was proud that even though his family moved to th US from Cuba he still practices his Cuban culture. Another reason that he was proud is that he has loving parents that want him to be successful in life. His parents helped him keep up with is culture by having family come over.\" My @CAPS1 Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary… regularly joined us at our table.\" (ph @NUM1) This quote shows that Narciso Rodriguez family came to join his parents and him for dinner. Narciso family gave up everything including leaving Cuba so he can have a better life. A life that his family can be proud of. The mood of this memoir is nonfiction. The mood is that because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about his past in his and it is about the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a Cuban, Italian, and a Spanish neighborhood. The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good). The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a nice apartment building. The mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring, I know this because the \"home\" is so pleasent to be inside. In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\", the mood created by the author was loving, caring, and appreciative. loving is what they did most because they basicly called everyone thier family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says that \"My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we call family, knowing that they would do the same for us\". Another mood was caring, because they wanted thier children to have a better life. A example is \"My mother and father had to come to this country with such courage, to give thier children a better life, leaving thier friends, families, and career in the country they loved\". This shows they care about thier kids. One last mood is appreciative. \"The barriers to work were strong and high, my parents had to accept that they both might not be able to find the Jobs they deserve, they had to start thier life over. These are the moods that was created by the author. The mood created @CAPS3 the author, Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives is Love and @CAPS2. Love is shown in this excerpt @CAPS3 how grateful he is for his parents and how he feels about then. In paragraph @NUM1 he says \"@CAPS1 often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than i could have ever done.\" @CAPS2 is shown @CAPS3 the Way, Narciso described the house he grew up in. Stated in paragraph @NUM2 that \"Here, in innocence of childhood, the congregation the family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" Love and @CAPS2 is expressed all throughout this memoir and I stated just a few examples of it. The author created such a specific mood for this memoir. She @CAPS1 off by telling alittle history of how she came to be in @LOCATION1 but quickly changed it to what her home was like. Narciso emphisized the importance of her culture but more importantly her family and friends. she talked about how the latin music, the big cuban cooking all made what is her home. She focuses more on the gratitude of her parents even more than her heritage and family bonds. She's focused on how her parents made a house a home.\n"

even get to meet his real grand parents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. </s> <s> The mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child. </s> <s> He gets to live a happy life in their new home, with their new friends. </s> <s> In this memoir gives a grateful feeling. </s> <s> Some of the reasons I think this is because like in paragraph @NUM1. </s> <s> The author says \"…our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuba, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevail in the United States.\" </s> <s> But the main part of the story is that how he loves the neighborhood he lives in and the house he lives in and mostly how much the people are basically family in that neighborhood. </s> <s> And that is why I think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir. </s> <s> In the story \"Narciso Rodriguez\", the mood in the story is willing, greatful, and hopeful. </s> <s> \"The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times\" that quote represents that the family was willing to go through not having a good job like in cuba and segragtion to make a better life for their kids. </s> <s> \"My parents always kept there door open for the people we considered family\" this quote shows the family was was greatful to have a home and still let the people they loved live there with them. </s> <s> \"My mother and Father came to this country with such courage, with out knowlage of the language and culture. </s> <s> That quote showed that the

was of his parents comming over to @LOCATION1 and starting a better life. </s> <s> Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important. </s> <s> The mood created in this memoir was very greatful. </s> <s> Narciso was very very greatful for the \"house that his parents turned into a home.\" </s>

his parents, not only for giving him things they never had, but things they did have, too. </s> <s> Things like teaching them how to cook, how to treat others, and the real meaning of family. </s> <s>

The mood being created is happiness and sadness. </s> <s> There is happiness because he was just born. </s> <s> The sadness is that they couldn't go to the hospital and they live in a two-family house. </s> <s> This is the moods created in the memior. </s> <s> The mood in this memoir was soft, with an exception. </s> <s> I say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood that's really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care. </s> <s> It's also saying that there was racism and segragation, so in that paragraph (which is the exception) the mood is more of a rougher mood, I say rougher as in \"a rough life,\" having to deal with racism and segragation. </s> <s> Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the camunity helps out by sometines cooking neals. </s> <s> This was nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend). </s> <s> And also, how they would house family until they were back on their feet and having the feeling that their familly would do the same. </s> <s> for them. </s> <s>

</s> <s> His memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them. </s> <s> He really wants people to be able to feel to happiness that he feels when he thinks about his home and his wonderful life that his parents provided for him. </s> <s> He realizes his luck and therefore his memoir is very upbeat and shows that even in hard times, you can live life to its full extent. </s> <s> In this memoir, there is more than one mood. </s> <s> There is love, friendship, and happiness Narciso expresses love for her parents and friends in paragraph @NUM1. </s> <s> \"In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" </s> <s> The author is saying that everyone comes toge-ther and that they all care for eachother. </s> <s> She expresses friendship in parag-raph @NUM2. </s> <s> When she says that her babysitter was her first friend. </s> <s> Finally, she expresses happiness. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM3, when she is saying \"she will never forget how her parents turned this simple house into a home. </s> <s> You could tell that she is happy, and grateful for her parents. </s> <s> Those are a @CAPS1 moods in the memoir. </s> <s> The mood of the excerpt is very bright. </s> <s> The author describes her risk taking, loving parents. </s> <s> The author describes the many things her parents have given to her. </s> <s> \"Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... </s> <s> Both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today... </s> <s> Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.\" </s> <s> As you can see, the author. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez, describes her young life and home with happiness and greatfullness. </s> <s> This is all generously spoken within the depths of the excerpt. </s> <s> Many authors enjoy using these tones to express their own personal feelings and opinions about the matter. </s> <s> In this case, the author wanted to express joy in her writing. </s> <s> The author created a very grateful/happy mood in the memoir. </s> <s> For example in paragraph @NUM1 when Narciso says \"I will always be greatful to my parents for the love and sacrifice. </s> <s> When he is saying this he is showing he is happy w/ his parents. </s> <s> I the memoir he talks about how he loves his house and why he loves his house and all the great memories in that house and that shows that this memoir mood is a more happy mood instead of sad for example paragraph @NUM2 when he says \"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house were a cuban feast always filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love.\" </s> <s> Also when he said in paragraph @NUM2 that\" It here where i learned the real defenition of family. </s> <s> And for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love. </s> <s> The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy. </s> <s> I think there is hapiness because of what it says on paragraph @NUM1. </s> <s> \"In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in a great solidarity and friendship.\" </s> <s> @CAPS2 that mean that there were a happy and friendly family. </s> <s> In conclusion, that's the mood I think the @CAPS1 created and some reasons why. </s> <s> The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. </s> <s> The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life. </s> <s> He also sounded grateful when he talked about the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other. </s> <s> He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of \"family\" while living in that house. </s> <s> By \"family\" he didn't mean blood relative Family. </s> <s> What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too. </s> <s> The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful. </s> <s> This memior created a warm, touching mood while he explained his childhood. </s> <s> I espicially think the part when he said \"Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and  endless celebrations that encomposed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home\", because it shows an overall perspective on a normal day during his childhood. </s> <s> Also, where he states that family \"has nothing to do with being a blood relative really makes his memior interesting because it is also teaching lessions.All in all, this memior was great, and the warming mood is something that I won't forget, and I hope that I too too can write a memior such as heart-warming and interesting as this one. </s> <s> The moods created by the author in the @CAPS2 were grate ful because of all the things that the parents did for their child. </s> <s> Friendly because they have \"family\" in the United states, and they Kept their arms, and door open for their \"family\". </s> <s> Also they had Courage because they didn't give, trying to learn the language, and finding a job. </s> <s> The last @CAPS1 that this @CAPS2 had was from paragraph seven, happiness, the chid has many memories of his/her Cuban heritage, Still listens to Cuban music, and was born and raised in the united states. </s> <s> The mood of the author is a very gental yet very happy tone. </s> <s> The reason it's gental is because he's describing how he grew up and what his life was like. </s> <s> To some people, they could just blab all day, but to most they have to dig through memories so that they can get the sceen just right. </s> <s> For example, \"Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 the parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail. </s> <s> For example, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today.\" </s> <s> The reason that he could remember this more clearly is because he probably cooks for his family using his parents resipies. </s> <s> The mood created by the author in this memoir is deffinitty being proud. </s> <s> The reason I think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life. </s> <s> Also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, to being a famous fashion designer. </s> <s> Lastly, this memior's mood also seems proud because he says, \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1, the author makes him seem proud of himself. </s> <s> In \"@PERSON1\" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. </s> <s> Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as \"aromas,\" \"endless,\" \"encompassed,\" \"instilled,\" etc. </s> <s> This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir. </s> <s> He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. </s> <s> As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. </s> <s> Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. </s> <s> The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. </s> <s> Phrases like \"(and for which I am eternaly grateful)\" and \"(which I adore to this day)\" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. </s> <s> Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating \"I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. </s> <s> As a result the mood of \"@PERSON1\" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the authors choice of words and statements. </s> <s> That is why I would describe the mood of \"@PERSON1\" as being very passionite and full of gratitude. </s> <s> The memoir's mood is a sense of happiness because its talking about a place where neighbors are like family and everyone is very close. </s> <s> Like how Sergio and @PERSON1 became his surrogate grandparents, when they were people who lived in the basement appartment. </s> <s> Alegria, his first friend normally ate dinner with them. </s> <s> The whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors. </s> <s> The overall mood created by the author of this memoir is one of complete gratefulness. </s> <s> The author is very, extremely thankful for his parents sacrifice, love, care and selflessness. </s> <s> He also creates a mood of happiness, unity and overall loving, that he has seen throughout his lifetime. </s> <s> The author describes his gratefulness towards his parents by remembering how they had to leave cuba, their native country, friends, family and jobs behind because they wished to give the child they wished for better life opportunities that could only be found in @LOCATION1. </s> <s> He thanks his parents repeatedly throughout the memoir for the love, caring, family, friends and selflessness they brought into his life. </s> <s> He describes situations where his parents had to make new friends and family from around their neighborhood and that from that a sense of love and friendship and unity was found. </s> <s> As his family got larger, the author talks about how his childhood, small, three-room apartment was made into a completed home. </s> <s> When all of these details combined, along with language such as. </s> <s> \"I've thanked them repeatedly,\" a mood and feeling of utter gratefulness is felt throughout the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\". </s> <s> The mood created by the author was a very grateful and happy mood in his memoir. </s> <s> For an example in paragraph six he states \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their Love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> This shows how grateful he is to his parents. </s> <s> He is also grateful to his friends and neighbors it states this in paragraph three when the author says \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" </s> <s> This shows that Narciso Rodriguez is very neighborey and that his neighbors portray the same happy, grateful, and neighborely outlook. </s> <s> so all of these reasons explain the mood of Narciso Rodriguez. </s> <s> In the memoir \"@PERSON1\" by @PERSON1 he describes the mood. </s> <s> The first thing is that the mood is love. </s> <s> For starters he says \"growing up in this envionment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. </s> <s> Over here, he is saying that your friends can be your family or the people that you love. </s> <s> Secondly he says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. </s> <s> Right here, he is saying that he thanks his parents for the life they had given him. </s> <s> Finally, he says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. </s> <s> Here he is saying that \"he will never forget when he was living in a home with family, In conclusion @PERSON1 rodriguez describes the mood but also his childhood When he learned about family. </s> <s> The mood created by the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" is very uplifting and happy. </s> <s> One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. </s> <s> Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says \"Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with a blood relative.\" </s> <s> I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. </s> <s> Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference. </s> <s> In the memoir the mood that the author created is the memoir can be @CAPS1 in two ways. </s> <s> first was happy for being created and being able to use america's beautifulfriendlyness. </s> <s> \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to a blood relative.\" </s> <s> @CAPS2 was that knowing that if you have hope anything can be achived. </s> <s> \"I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. </s> <s> In this memoir author creates a very specific mood that is the Same throughout the memoir. </s> <s> The mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood. </s> <s> One way that this mood was @CAPS1 was that they talked how their enviorment Showed a great sense of family and when I think of family I see the mood as comforting and happy. </s> <s> \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative\". </s> <s> This showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed @CAPS2 reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met. </s> <s> \"It was a close nit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were Clearly in need\". </s> <s> This is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood. </s> <s> The mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lave. </s> <s> An example from the text says \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. </s> <s> They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers in the country they loved .\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 example from the text says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. </s> <s> I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. </s> <s> I've often told them my admiration for the strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. </s> <s> But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" </s> <s> In conclusion because of his parents love for him they sacrificed alot, so he could have a happy and good life. </s> <s> The mood Created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy. </s> <s> The reason I say that because if my parents did that I should be very grateful because they did all this for me to be happy and for me to have a better life. </s> <s> \"And for which I am eternally grateful\". </s> <s> \"They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life\". </s> <s> Wow that @CAPS1 alot from his/her parents they are very strong and they did all for their children to be happy. </s> <s> This is the reason why I picked those two mood in the memoir! </s> <s> The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. </s> <s> But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. </s> <s> I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. </s> <s> For example, @PERSON1 says \"here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.\" </s> <s> And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. </s> <s> For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> and in a way thanks his parents for everything. </s> <s> So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir. </s> <s> The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. </s> <s> How the parents turned the \"simple house\" into the \"traditional Cuban home\" was shocking. </s> <s> The parents played the \"Passionate Cuban music.\" </s> <s> and \"a love of cooking\" helped create a family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage. </s> <s> \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relitave. </s> <s> This family loved spending time w/ eachother, and celebrating. </s> <s> Over all, the mood is loving, happy, and caring. </s> <s> In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 created a certain mood. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez created a gentle mood that stayed constant. </s> <s> @CAPS1 tells how his parents \"always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family.\" </s> <s> Which means @CAPS1 probably grew up in a life without very much violence. </s> <s> @CAPS1 also says that @CAPS1 \"will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 wants his parents to know that @CAPS1 loves them very much and lets them know by thinking them. </s> <s> Lastly @CAPS1 @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 \"will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> The sense of gentleness stays throughout the whole memoir because @CAPS1 is always saying the good things about his life, not the bad. </s> <s> The mood Created by the @CAPS2 in the memoir was happy. </s> <s> First thing @CAPS1 the mood is happy Of this memoir is when the @CAPS2 wrote \"Passionate Cuban music (which I dore to this day)\" that meant that @CAPS3 really love her Culture music. </s> <s> Another thing is when @CAPS3 said \"Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, And for that true you dont have to be related to someone who really love to say that he/@CAPS3 is @CAPS5 of your family is Just enoght that he/@CAPS3 love and care about you like you for he/@CAPS3. </s> <s> Last thing is when the @CAPS2 said \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, that meant that @CAPS3 will never Forget that her family began so small And then turn big because their family went to their house and they stared their new life in the house. </s> <s> The author was @CAPS2 likely describing his happy @CAPS1. </s> <s> Because in the memair it was talking about how he loved his home and his parents Cooking and music. </s> <s> He was @CAPS2 grateful for his parents caring and selflessness. </s> <s> He liked how his home was a community for Spanish, cuban, and italian immagrants. </s> <s> He thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts and it made him happy. </s> <s> This is my summary of Narciso Rodriguez's mood of the story. </s> <s> In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. </s> <s> Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood. </s> <s> Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. </s> <s> In paragraph six, Narciso says, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,\" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. </s> <s> Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. </s> <s> He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. </s> <s> Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. </s> <s> Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. </s> <s> In the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez,\" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optomistic man. </s> <s> The mood described by the author in the memoir is a greatful and happy feeling I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, Always brings up how he is greatful for his partents helping him in his childhood. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM1, \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> Also, the mood is a happy mood. </s> <s> I think this because the story states, \"At tine when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great soidarity and friendship.\" </s> <s> Even though there is racism, @CAPS1 one is friends. </s> <s> The overall mood in Narciso's memoir is admiration and gratefullness towards his parents. </s> <s> He expresses his gratitude several times. </s> <s> Like on paragraph @NUM1. </s> <s> It says \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. </s> <s> They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 all of paragraph @NUM1 is about how grateful he is to his parents. </s> <s> Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. </s> <s> \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. </s> <s> I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done\" Also all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his admiration towards his parents. </s> <s> So, the mood @CAPS1 in the memoir was love, towards his parents. </s> <s> In the non--fiction memoir \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso talks about his life growing up, his home, and the people around him. </s> <s> The author considered his neighbors family also, rather than just his parents and brothers and sisters. </s> <s> \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative... a close knit community.\" </s> <s> (par @NUM1) This gives the memoir a friendly mood, it shows that the author loved his whole neighborhood. </s> <s> The author also invited his neighbors into his home and was very close to them. </s> <s> \"Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria... lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table... more often than not. </s> <s> Also at the table... my surrogate grandparents.\" </s> <s> (par @NUM2) This gives the memoir an inviting mood, the author always had friends and neighbors over for dinner. </s> <s> The author also talks about how grateful he is for his parents. </s> <s> \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> (par @NUM3) this gives the memoir a sweet mood, the author shows his happiness and gratefulness for everything his parents had done for him. </s> <s> In conclusion the authors  sets a very sweet, inviting mood, by adding details of how joyful, and enjoyable his childhood was. </s> <s> The mood created in this memoir is comfort. </s> <s> To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. </s> <s> They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. </s> <s> There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. </s> <s> Another thing is the lifestyle. </s> <s> I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. </s> <s> They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. </s> <s> I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. </s> <s> It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. </s> <s> That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort. </s> <s> The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. </s> <s> The author was explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and felt. </s> <s> The boy thought that his parents were really great and he thought that he could never be like them. </s> <s> He was also grateful that he had house and parents like you did. </s> <s> He admired his parents and what they did. </s> <s> He will never forget growing up and living in that house. </s> <s> The purpose of the author was to show you how grateful someone was of what there parents did when they immagrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. </s> <s> There was a mood created by the author in @CAPS1 memoir. </s> <s> Here are some points to help support this parenthesis identify a new mood, his gratefulness, and his view on things. </s> <s> First, parenthesis identify a new mood. </s> <s> When it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back. </s> <s> Here is my reason why the story, \"Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen.\" </s> <s> @CAPS2, his gratefulness. </s> <s> @CAPS1 is very grateful for how things turned out. </s> <s> Here another reason why from the story. </s> <s> \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> @CAPS3, his view on things. </s> <s> @CAPS1 had very fortunate times in his eyes. </s> <s> Ultamately these were my reasons for the mood that was created by the author parenthesis, gratefulness, and his perspective. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. </s> <s> I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. </s> <s> He is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. </s> <s> One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: \"I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. </s> <s> I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done.\" </s> <s> This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. </s> <s> Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: \"they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love.\" </s> <s> In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful. </s> <s> I believe that the mood created by the author is happy and loving. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM1 it states \"Growing up in the enviorment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 not only the people blood related to your is your family but also friends and anyone close to you. </s> <s> The excerpt also states \"It was in this simple house that my parents welcome other refugees to celebrate their arival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays.\" </s> <s> This shows the love that everyone has for one another. </s> <s> Lastly the excerpt states \"It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. </s> <s> It was here where I learned the real definition of family.\" </s> <s> This part makes you feel warm and happy about family. </s> <s> People make sacrafices for the ones they love. </s> <s> That is called being selfless. </s> <s> In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. </s> <s> They left their family and friends to give their son a better life. </s> <s> The author makes an enjoyable and heartwarming mood.Narciso is very greatful. </s> <s> He said he has \"learned the definition of 'family' \". </s> <s> His parents wanted a better life for him. </s> <s> They gave up a lot and he recognize that. </s> <s> Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. </s> <s> He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. </s> <s> \"I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" </s> <s> It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. </s> <s> @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. </s> <s> They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. </s> <s> Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. </s> <s> Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. </s> <s> I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons. </s> <s> Put others before yourself, and work hard. </s> <s> In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives has a happy mood. </s> <s> The author talks about \"passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen\" In paragraph @NUM1 which makes the house seem very happy and joyful. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM1 the author also says \"within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home the very heart of our kitchen\" this makes the author seem very happy since they like to cook. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez talks about \"it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and @CAPS1 celebrated my first birthdays\" the mood here seems that everybody liked to come to this house. </s> <s> This whole memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" makes the mood seem very happy and warm. </s> <s> The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and/or thankfull mood. </s> <s> The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. </s> <s> However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their \"family\". </s> <s> By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. </s> <s> Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. </s> <s> By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him. </s> <s> The mood created by the memoir is shown by many things. </s> <s> Through positive words, often mentioned thankfulness, and a cosy setting, a happy positive mood is shown. </s> <s> Positive words are oftem mentioned in the article for example it @CAPS1 \"It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people,\" in this the words honest, hardworking, and the pease \"extended a hand,\" (which means offered help) all invoke a happy mood. </s> <s> The authors constant thanking of things, like as the memoir states \"(and for which I am eternally thankful)\", gives a happy mood because people are only thankful for positive things. </s> <s> Finally this positive mood is shown through setting, which sounds happy and is described as nice. </s> <s> as the memoir @CAPS1 \"within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.\" </s> <s> This descibtion of the setting shows a clear happy cosy, positive mood. </s> <s> The mood created by the memoir is happy, positie, and nice because the memoir is worded with positve words, has often mentioned thankfulness, and has a nice setting. </s> <s> Before reading about @PERSON1 I don't think I read about anyone who is more happy than @PERSON1. </s> <s> @PERSON1 is very happy about being an @CAPS1 citizen and still be very happy of having another country's background (in this case Cuba). </s> <s> @PERSON1 was blessed that he had his house. </s> <s> It was in a great neighborhood and the kitchen was the main place of the house. </s> <s> @PERSON1 was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house. </s> <s> @PERSON1 was very happy about his parents, most of all. </s> <s> Without his parents he would have lived in Cuba and would not have known his great neighborhood and all of his family and friends. </s> <s> In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he thinks the definition of \"family\" is. </s> <s> He is very specific in that he believes \"family\" doesn't mean blood relatives, \"family\" is about friends and family coming together to form a community. </s> <s> Where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect. </s> <s> He

whole memoir is about love, family which sets a positive mood for the reader. </s> <s> The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very touching. </s> <s> the memoir explains how as a kid he didnt have much growing upas a kid but he did have family and he was extreamly greatful and proud of his parents for their efforts to start a new family in a different country without knowing the languge. </s> <s> When I hear about someone being that @CAPS1 it makes me think how times have changed from whe Narciso was growing up in the @NUM1's. </s> <s> He was so greatful and happy when compaired to now he has nothing. </s> <s> But he was abel to show all his gratude with the deepest heart warming simpathyall in all @CAPS2 learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing you can have. </s> <s> This memoirs mood is fairly consistent throughout the whole piece. </s> <s> This story is about how @PERSON1 parents created a home. </s> <s> His parents put

a mix of many things. </s> <s> Love, generosity, and greatfulness. </s> <s> The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. </s> <s> To them, family was your community and friends. </s> <s> They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner. </s> <s> The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. </s> <s> They would do kind things for them. </s> <s> They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. </s> <s> The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author. </s> <s> The author says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> The mood in this memoir is created by the people and family who live there, and go there. </s> <s> The mood  in the memoir could

friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. </s> <s> I have lots of appreshiation because its just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best fer us. </s> <s> I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to @LOCATION1. </s> <s> They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. </s> <s> Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. </s> <s> The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. </s> <s> The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story. </s> <s> The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. </s> <s> The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. </s> <s> One of the memories is the kitchen. </s> <s> Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. </s> <s> He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. </s> <s> He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. </s> <s> Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism,

scientists back in cuba but moved to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. </s> <s> This taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money. </s> <s> Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true deffinition of family. </s> <s> The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a caring, happy, and thoughtful mood. </s> <s> By mentioning the Cuban traditions shared in the neighborhood between close friends, and cooking in the kitchen to share a great meal with one another the mood is happy. </s> <s> When Narciso talks about the great friends he made from different heritages and knowing the entire community like family the mood is thoughtful and caring because it shows that the people really appreciated each other's company. </s> <s> It is also caring in the story when Narciso talks about how his parents devoted their lives to making sure that their children and the people they knew had good lives to. </s> <s> When Narciso describes the way his parents struggled during the cold winters, yet they always let others in, shows a very caring mood in the memoir. </s> <s> I also think that the fact that a small, simple apartment they lived in is very important to Narciso because he repeats it several times. </s> <s> I think he does this to show a thoughtful for mood, in that the house was small but through creativity in bringing culture in made it seem much bigger. </s> <s> The mood created by the author was one of happiness, love, and caring. </s> <s> Not only does it show in his style, but the author also gives details that really create the vibe. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes the food as \"rich culinary skills and love of cooking,\" and the music as \"passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" </s> <s> This creates a homely affect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many \"family members\" that came over for meals. </s> <s> The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked hard to get where they were for the faith that their children would have a better life than they had. </s> <s> With all of the details, the author creates a loving, cultural affect can only be found with great family and friends. </s> <s> Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. </s> <s> Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. </s> <s> The outcome of that is success. </s> <s> Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. </s> <s> As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. </s> <s> They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. </s> <s> The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life. </s> <s> The author creates a mood that he is very greatful to his parents. </s> <s> His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, (wich he loves to cook). </s> <s> \"(and for wich I am eternally greatful).\" </s> <s> His main greatfullness, is of their love and sacrifise. </s> <s> They would take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, wich he found amazing. </s> <s> \"I will allways be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> And he is not affraid to let them know, \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repetedly.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 the memoir, the auther creates a mood that he is greatful to all his parents love and sacrifices, not only to himself, but to everyone they've helped. </s> <s> I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness made up of many different moods. </s> <s> The other moods are reminisceance and hapiness. </s> <s> Thankfulness is focused on in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez talks about thankful he is his parents gave up so much to come to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. </s> <s> He also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were. </s> <s> He showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like. </s> <s> Lastly happiness which is mostly his mood when he remineses his past and family. </s> <s> Those are the moods of his meimor. </s> <s> In this memoir about @PERSON1 the reader learns alot about the @CAPS1 by the mood (or tone) of the memoir. </s> <s> The mood of this memoir is greatful, because he is thinking of all the opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless. </s> <s> In the memor the reader learns that parent makes so many sacrifices for their children that helping around the house and thanking them is the least they can do. </s> <s> In conclusion the mood in the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is, happy, and greatful because of the sacrifices made by his parents. </s> <s> A good citation for this is \"even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" </s> <s> The author creates a loving, and caring mood. </s> <s> He makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms. </s> <s> That if you are feeling down they would pick you right up with a warm meal and a cozzy bead. </s> <s> He describes that they left Cuba to come

parents) to endure these hard times.\" </s> <s> This gives a mood of pride and great triumph. </s> <s> That is the mood that @PERSON1 gives in the memoir from \"Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives.\" </s> <s> The mood created by the author in the memoir is a verry happy tone. </s> <s> The reasons that its a happy tone is because @CAPS1 tells about her Childhood hapily by talking about the unity of his invirorment and the happiiness, cuban food, and Cuban music that filled his home and that still fills his home today because he injoyes it so much. </s> <s> The mood in the memoir, which the author is trying to show you is pretty much the happiness and gratefullness that Narciso Rodriguez has to be cuban. </s> <s> Narciso is bringing the mood of happiness in this memoir learning all about his Cuban background and how much he is greatful for his mom and dad. </s> <s> The author is trying to show you appriciation and gratefulness. </s> <s> This whole memoir is trying to show readers how great it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things. </s> <s> This memoir is representing good moods and happiness. </s> <s> To always be grateful for what you have in you life, exspecially your family, friends, & your life. </s> <s> The mood in this memoir is very happy and gratefull In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives there is a mood of happyness created. </s> <s> There are several examples from the article that show happyness. </s> <s> The first example is \"they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life\". </s> <s> Narciso's parents left everything they had just to give their son a better life. </s> <s> This made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him. </s> <s> The second example is \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> This shows he is very aware all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much. </s> <s> The third and final example is \"It was here I learded the true definition of family.\" </s> <s> Where he moved to his parents, siblings, and neighbors became his \"family\" and although he didn't know all of his \"real\" family he was happy with the one he had. </s> <s> Those three examples show the mood of the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\". </s> <s> Based on the memoir \"Narciso @CAPS1\" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a very powerful and posative mood. </s> <s> One strong example of this is how he expresses his parents. </s> <s> He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like \"always be greatful for my parents\",  \"admiration for their strength\", \"perseverance\", and \"generosity.\" </s> <s> The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. </s> <s> Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. </s> <s> He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. </s> <s> The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. </s> <s> He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez expresses a very positive and powerful mood about his family and his culture throughout the excerpt. </s> <s> The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a ceartain mood in his memoir. </s> <s> That certain mood was love and family. </s> <s> The reason why love and family is the moood is because of the following reasons. </s> <s> Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood realitives. </s> <s> It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. </s> <s> Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him. </s> <s> A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family. </s> <s> They always came over and had dinner babysat him and every thing that is why it is love. </s> <s> As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created. </s> <s> This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. </s> <s> It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. </s> <s> Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. </s> <s> If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. </s> <s> The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. </s> <s> For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. </s> <s> Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them. </s> <s> The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. </s> <s> The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. </s> <s> The word greatful was repeated over and over again. </s> <s> Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. </s> <s> \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. </s> <s> While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. </s> <s> Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. </s> <s> \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" </s> <s> This is how the author looks at his memories. </s> <s> They are always cheerful and warm. </s> <s> In the last sentence of the memoir he says \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful. </s> <s> The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. </s> <s> Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, \"Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative.\" </s> <s> Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. </s> <s> Another example of mood is the last sentence, \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. </s> <s> In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home. </s> <s> A happy, grateful, and proud mood is expressed by the author in this memoir. </s> <s> The author, Narciso, expressed a grateful and happy mood by describing things his parents did for him that he was grateful for, as well as happy to have. </s> <s> \"... a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). </s> <s> Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" </s> <s> (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The author also expressed his pride in the story, by stating and describingwhat his parent's did that he was proud of. </s> <s> \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture.\" </s> <s> (@CAPS1 @NUM2) \"they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.\" </s> <s> (@CAPS1 @NUM2) These were the moods the author expressed in the memoir. </s> <s> The mood created by the author was very happy. </s> <s> The author was grateful to his parents. </s> <s> For example in paragraph @NUM1: \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> The author thanks his parents repeatedly for their strength. </s> <s> For example in paragraph @NUM1: \"I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 will never forget his home. </s> <s> For example from paragraph @NUM3: \"I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> The mood was very happy. </s> <s> The author was grateful, thankful, and never forgot his home. </s> <s> The mood created in the memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives\", is a mixture of happiness, relaxation, and gratefulness, even thought the memoir sometimes states how @PERSON1' parents had to give up their jobs in Cuba, and how overt racism was normal and segregation prevailed in the United States at the time, giving the mood as sadness, the article mainly consists Of happy memories. </s> <s> An example of this can be found throughout the story, especially in the ending paragraph when Narciso Rodriguez sums up the memoir and expresses how grateful he was toward his parents and the childhood he had. </s> <s> Also in the third and fourth paragraphs when he talks about his neighbors and how everybody got along with eachother, and how they frequently had meals together, I find the mood to be relaxing in paragraph three and four also, but mainly in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about his kitchen and the smells, aromas, and music that used to dance through the air. </s> <s> The over all mood of the memoir could be considered gratefullness. </s> <s> I could be considered gratefulness because Narciso Rodriguez always states how grateful he is for his parents and child hood. </s> <s> The mood in the story is very homely and happiness. </s> <s> The author clearly loved their childhood and was filled by great experiences and a loving background. </s> <s> The author was very greatful for the parents for what they have done. </s> <s> For moving to @LOCATION1, making sacrifices, wanting a better life for them. </s> <s> Also how their home was a great enviroment. </s> <s> always open, cozy, and loving. </s> <s> The mood of the cooking, family coming together, and of the cheerful music is just great. </s> <s> The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. </s> <s> It symbolizes togetherness and coming together as a family. </s> <s> In this passage evry one is caring and open to anyone living with them. </s> <s> The child in this story talks abou how greatful they are for there parints. </s> <s> Their happy because their all a family living together as one. </s> <s> Evry one is exsepting of one and another. </s> <s> Over all I think the mood is happy. </s> <s> The mood created by the auther in the memoir is happyness because in the memoir it describes how many memories are in his house, and it is also happyness because he mentioned his family and friends, and how peacful it is Also because he describes that there was a @CAPS1 cuban music that filled the air. </s> <s> He also described were his house is and he loves cooking, and he describes it as a rich culenary cooking that he loves so much. </s> <s> The author, Narciso Rodriguez, uses detailed descriptions of her childhood to create a warm, gentle, and grateful mood in the passage The memoir begins with Rodriguez explaining her Cuban heritage and how big of a role that played in her life This creates an idea of pride and love for who you are. </s> <s> Narcisco goes on to say how her parents were ways welcoming and inviting and how they sacrificied basically their whole life so they could make a better life for their children. </s> <s> In the final paragraphs the author expresses pure graditutity for everything her parents have given up and done. </s> <s> In one line Rodriguez praises parents when she thanks them again saying, \"there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" </s> <s> All of these details contribute to the overall mood of the memoir. </s> <s> In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by @PERSON1 he writes mainly about how grateful he is for everything he grew up with and is truly the mood created by the author. </s> <s> Narciso is grateful for his cuban culture and how it was incorperated into his life growing up even though he was in New Jersey. </s> <s> He is also grateful for his parents and the sacrafices they made for him in order to grow up in @LOCATION2. </s> <s> His parents also taught him to be kind to everyone, and treat everyone like family. </s> <s> He is grateful for that. </s> <s> There are

were actually two main moods. </s> <s> The first mood and most prominant mood was joy and happyness. </s> <s> Because throught the memoir the reader learns about the writers family and how greatfull the writer was for her family. </s> <s> An example of this is when the writer wrote: \"I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir. </s> <s> Meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. </s> <s> Therefor sadness is also a mood in this memoir. </s> <s> In the end, the joyfull mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a sense of where the writer is coming from the reader most consider both these moods. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and greatful mood throughout the memoir. </s> <s> He did this @CAPS1 never premoting himself, but always thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way where everybody helped eachother. </s> <s> Fer example in @CAPS2 @NUM1, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life. </s> <s> He states, \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. </s> <s> They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows apretiation towards them, which then gives the reader a sense of gratefulness. </s> <s> Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes how his neighborhood was like a family. </s> <s> He stated, \"Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. </s> <s> Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. </s> <s> In an neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" </s> <s> This @CAPS2 gave me a sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through. </s> <s> So it gives the reader a sense of caringness. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez produce a mood of caringness and greatfulness throughout his memoir. </s> <s> There are many moods that the author creates in the story, \"Narciso Rodriguez\", from Home: The Blueprints of our lives. </s> <s> Some moods it creats are sad, brave, and thankfull. </s> <s> The author creats a sad mood in many ways. </s> <s> One way he creats a sad mood in the article is in paragraph @NUM1,

will always be greatful to his @CAPS1. </s> <s> Leaving your freinds and families behind is a brave action.He also creates a sad mood when he says that all imigrants come selflessly to this country to give their children a better life. </s> <s> The author is showing that he knows how immigrants come to @LOCATION1. </s> <s> He also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things. </s> <s>

created by the author in the memoir is loving, caring, and gratefulness. </s> <s> Throughout the memoir the author continuosly mentions how grateful she is to her parents. </s> <s> and how much she loves them. </s> <s> She says that \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> The author means that she's thankful her parents love her enough to give up their

stating that it takes a lot of carage to go forward to an unknown futue, and she's very greatful that her parents did. </s> <s> The quote show the loving, caring, and gratefulness expressed in the memoir by the author. </s> <s> The mood is a mixture of things, it's really hard to say withe all the emotions the author throws around. </s> <s> But however the strongest feeling is unity, and family.I'm Not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is I think something that can be described by several. </s> <s> One of course is unity, or as he says it, \"great solidarity and friendship\"it's rather sweet how he charectorizes family as something as the bonds you make withe people in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family s always first. </s> <s> So in a way I think his way of thinking comes from his culture.But also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. </s> <s> As they say \"happiness is nothing without appreciating it\" and as he says \"I learned the real defnetion of family\" so apparently he knows real happiness The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy because the atsmothsphere is filled with family and friends also joy and happyness. </s> <s> The considered everyone family even though the times were not the greatest for everyone also his parents gave up a lot

here for him. </s> <s> This is the mood created by the author in the memoir. </s> <s> The mood created by this memoir is a relaxed caring kind of mood. </s> <s> Several parts of this work emphasize this mood. </s> <s> The author often writes about how he loves his parents for their selflesness. </s> <s> This emphasizes the mood, and he repeats it many times and the repetition helps build mood as well. </s> <s> A final thing that helps the mood is how he describes how everyone in his nieghborhood was kind to each other. </s> <s> In conclusion, there are many things in this work that emphasize a relaxed, caring mood. </s> <s> Within the walls of narciso, her young parents created there traditional @CAPS1 home, There heart was the kitchen. </s> <s> Narciso parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on there rich culinar skills to narciso she love to cook. </s> <s> Quite the countrary narciso neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish Italian immigrants at a time racism. </s> <s> her parents came selflessly, as some immigrants will do, to give their children a better life. </s> <s> They sacafised leaving their family friends and careers, in the county they came from I think her memory is a nice, happy one becuase with those memorys she knows what her family went through. </s> <s> The mood created by the author was love from his family The author describes \"a love of (cuban) cooking which is still with me (the author) today\" and how \"Passionate cuban music which I (the author) still adore today.\" </s> <s> The author got this love from his parents. </s> <s> Another way the author created the mood of love was by talking about how his \"parents always kept there arms and door open.\" </s> <s> I know that it takes a lot to be able to let anyone into your home. </s> <s> The authors speaking very lovingly at this point in the story. </s> <s> The author also says that he \"will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> This also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship The mood that the author set during the story was love. </s> <s> I think that this was a really good mood to set in a story. </s> <s> I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. </s> <s> In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that \"I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" </s> <s> I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. </s> <s> He wants to tell us about what they did for him. </s> <s> Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home.' </s> <s> The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 is different and uneek to other I have heard. </s> <s> I belive that the @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 is trying to make is happyness, and selflessness, and grateful. </s> <s> I think this because he describes his parents As selflessness and takes everyone in to theire small Apartment. </s> <s> I also think he is creating \"warth\" by saying that his first birthday with his parent Are comfortting That is the @CAPS1 I belive the @CAPS3 is trying to create. </s> <s> c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. </s> <s> He often talks about his nationality. </s> <s> He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. </s> <s> He is also married. </s> <s> He lives in the @DATE1's. </s> <s> In america. </s> <s> He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. </s> <s> He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. </s> <s> And his family. </s> <s> Also Narciso childhood. </s> <s> His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. </s> <s> That was the memoir of this passage. </s> <s> The mood in the memoir is grateful. </s> <s> It is grateful in a few ways. </s> <s> One way is in paragraph six he says \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. </s> <s> I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. </s> <s> I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly.\" </s> <s> This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. </s> <s> Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says \"my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). </s> <s> Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" </s> <s> This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him. </s> <s> Those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful. </s> <s> The mood  Created by the author in the memoir is a happy One because in the memoir Narciso was happy with with all her parents did for her and the neighborhood was a peace one, every body reached out to help who ever needed help. </s> <s> The memoir looks back on his childhood, with fondness, so I'd call the mood whistful. </s> <s> Yes, the author creates a whistful mood, by talking about his childhood home, friends and family. </s> <s> But... whistfulness only lasts until the end of paragraph @NUM1... after that it becomes a greatful mood, where he's giving out thanks and describing what his parents went through. </s> <s> If it is possible to have two moods, then this memoir does. </s> <s> The moods are both whistful and greatful. </s> <s> Yes. </s> <s> The mood of the author and the memoir is greatful. </s> <s> The author is very greatful for his parents. </s> <s> He is thankful for his parents because they gave up their life for him. </s> <s> They moved from their country so that he could grow up in @LOCATION1. </s> <s> His parents quit their jobs and came over all for him. </s> <s> He is also greatful for his extended family and friends. </s> <s> They are the ones who he eats with, plays with and etc. </s> <s> He takes care of them and they take care of him. </s> <s> They are his surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles cousins and friends. </s> <s> He is also thank full for his culture. </s> <s> All his food along with traditions come from cuba. </s> <s> The author is greatful. </s> <s> The mood created by the author is both @CAPS1 and love. </s> <s> At first the mood the author created was @CAPS1. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"They struggled both personally and financially.\" </s> <s> Narciso explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live in @LOCATION1. </s> <s> So by reading the excerpt based on the poverty and struggles his family faced makes you grow @CAPS1 for them. </s> <s> I also chose love. </s> <s> In the excerpt it states. </s> <s> \"It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\". </s> <s> And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.\" </s> <s> @CAPS3 the excerpt the author explains the love he learned to form for the \"family\" @CAPS3 the neighborhood. </s> <s> Therefore that's why I think love is another mood created by the author. </s> <s> These are the reasons I chose both @CAPS1 and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt. </s> <s> The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in mostly all of the paragraphs he talks about how much he loves his parents and his cuban culture. </s> <s> Narciso talks about how his parents made his everyday house into a home. </s> <s> That is why I think Narciso is happy in this memior. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM1 it says \"Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen.\" </s> <s> The author is very happy and satisfied with the family he has and want his family has done. </s> <s> The author appriciate what his parents has done to other of his parents that immigrated from Cuba. </s> <s> He dedicates what he has learned such as cooking, manners, and friendship to his parents. </s> <s> The author \"admires the strenght and preseverance and have thanked them repeatedly.\" </s> <s> overall the author could not had a better family then this, they showed them how to live and that is what a families should accomplish. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blueprints of our Lives shared his feelings, traditions, and Love he shared with his family growing up.Narciso and his @CAPS1 and dad were cuban. </s> <s> they shared their cuban traditions with eachother and were warm and welcoming with eachother and other people. </s> <s> Narciso's family was generous to other people and shared with everyone. </s> <s> they were all kind to eachother and lived a traditional @CAPS2.Narciso emphasized a mood during the memoir .. </s> <s> The love and meaning of family. </s> <s> In this memoir it talks about what the true meaning of selflessness and a home really is. </s> <s> At the beginning of this memoir they talk about how their parents knew the struggles of a life. </s> <s> And would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet. </s> <s> It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house.Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive. </s> <s> His parents loved to cook and taught Narciso how to. </s> <s> They also play traditional Cuban music. </s> <s> Also, they taught him to be selfless. </s> <s> They would invite people over even if they weren't the same race because it didn't matter to them. </s> <s> The mood created in this memoir is love and unity. </s> <s> (@CAPS1 @NUM1) \"... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" </s> <s> This means that they were close, loving, and unified. </s> <s> This memoir gave me the feeling that just a house is not a home until there is love. </s> <s> \"Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen\". </s> <s> This also gives me the feeling of warmth and love. </s> <s> In my opinion the mood is created by the auther in the memoir by the setting and describing her child hood, where she was born and why her parents came here. </s> <s> The reason I think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. </s> <s> Some examples from the excerpt are, \"In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey.\" </s> <s> Also, \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being blood relative.\" </s> <s> The author is very thankful for her cuban heritage and her home is about relationship then just space. </s> <s> In this memoir the mood created the setting. </s> <s> The mood the author created in this memoir was very proud. </s> <s> I could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here. </s> <s> For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says, \"My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" </s> <s> I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that because he is talking about how his parents left every thing basicly for him. </s> <s> Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either. </s> <s> He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride The @CAPS1 creates a mood of happiness in the @CAPS2. </s> <s> He states memories of his child that made him happy. </s> <s> He mentions the love that he had of cooking with his parents. </s> <s> He also mentions music as being passionate and that he still adores it even to this day. </s> <s> He also describes how good his neighborhood was and how they were a close knit community. </s> <s> Then he startes to explain that a lot of his family was not just blood related but how it included other people. </s> <s> He then explained that he's parents were very self sacrafising people. </s> <s> So it was a very good mood the @CAPS1 wrote the @CAPS2 in. </s> <s> The mood the @CAPS1 creates is happy. </s> <s> He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up. </s> <s> His parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life. </s> <s> Also the feel of his home reflected on the mood. </s> <s> It was a warm and safe environment in paragraph @NUM1 it states, \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.\" </s> <s> @CAPS2 can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood. </s> <s> The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and family-like. </s> <s> The author goes to describe his family, which were loving but poor. </s> <s> His family supported him by growing up in a happy loving home. </s> <s> They cooked nice food, and invited the relatives over to eat. </s> <s> The author show that no matter if your rich or poor, you can still have a closely knit family. </s> <s> The mood created by the author in the memoir would be describe happy and thankful. </s> <s> I say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless. </s> <s> They always helped out people in need. </s> <s> The author loved how he grew up with his cuban culture and how he would never forget it. </s> <s> He said that was one house hold he would never forget. </s> <s> There is a mood created by the author in the memoir.One way in which the mood is created is by explaining how the warm life in the narrator's house was created. </s> <s> \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" </s> <s> (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This helps create the mood of the memoir because it is explaining how the narrator grew up.Another way in which the mood is created is by showing how caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. </s> <s> \"I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This gave the memoir a light and happy mood.A third way in which the mood is created is by showing how friendly everyone was with each other. </s> <s> \"In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" </s> <s> The narrator explained how friendly and open everybody in the neighborhood was with one another.As you can see, the author of the memoir created a late mood in the memoir. </s> <s> In the memoir the authors tone is loving. </s> <s> The way he describes his Cuban heritage and culture is full of pride for being Cuban. </s> <s> In @LOCATION1 two he states that he is eternally grateful for having had his parents \"rich culinary skills and a love of cooking\" passed on to him. </s> <s> Then at the end in @LOCATION1 seven his tone is once again loving and grateful. </s> <s> In the very last sentence it is noticeable. </s> <s> \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> In this memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\", by Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is happy.The mood is happy because everyone in the memoir are enjoying their lives and their not worrying about anything. </s> <s> As explained in the memoir, even when @PERSON1 and Rawedia had to start their lives over entirely, they didnt hesitate. </s> <s> Their family were happy, they partied, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they \"always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family.\" </s> <s> In this memoir Narciso enjoyed his life and looked up to his parents for everything they did for him. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso exclaimed that he will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, which showed their happiness in this memoir. </s> <s> In the memoir Narciso rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. </s> <s> They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. </s> <s> but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. </s> <s> I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. </s> <s> The author does an excellent job for creating many moods in this memoir. </s> <s> One of the moods, is love. </s> <s> Love is a mood in this memoir because @PERSON1's parents took ten people who needed somewhere to stay, because they know that those people would do the same thing for them. </s> <s> Another example of love is when @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM1, \"they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\" </s> <s> The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which, is another mood. </s> <s> It does this by having the author point out how little his house was, and how his parents did everything they could to give them a better life. </s> <s> It really makes one look back, and see how much their parents have done for them. </s> <s> Well first the authur feels happy and exsited but he also feels sad cause he is moving to @LOCATION1. </s> <s> In 1961 he was born but In that time he met a friend which was his Babysitter and she was his first friend she lived up stairs from them he has alot of family members but wen he moved to @LOCATION1 his mom and dad took his people that need a home Just until they can get back up on there feet he wants to see his grandparents that cant leave until 1970. </s> <s> But he told his mom and dad he will always be grateful to them for their love and sacrifice he often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than he could have ever done he also often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance andt he thanked them The mood would be loving and carring. </s> <s> When @CAPS1 was a child growing up in @LOCATION2, his parents treasrd familey and friends. </s> <s> They taught him to always lend a helping and and to alway keep his door open. </s> <s> \"Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was maid up of mostly spanish, cuban, and italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States.\" </s> <s> It was a close knit comunity and everybody knew everybody. </s> <s> Nobody was a stranger. </s> <s> \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us\". </s> <s>

united. </s> <s> \"My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language of the culture. </s> <s> They came selflessly\" this shows that he wanted the readers to know how caring and loving his parents were. </s> <s> There is a warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1. </s> <s> This mood is portrayed in many ways. </s> <s> One way the mood is portrayed is by telling us about @PERSON1's parents. </s> <s> And how there home is always open or how theres always ton of people at the dinner table. </s> <s> Another way they portrayed this mood is by @PERSON1 stating \"there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity.... the demonstration of how important my friends and family are. </s> <s> This is how they show the warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1. </s> <s> The author of Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso Rodriguez made the @CAPS1 feel happy and welcome. </s> <s> When he talked about the different

during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM1 he says \"It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\". </s> <s> And for this I will never

<s> Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. </s> <s> @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. </s> <s> This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. </s> <s> This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. </s> <s> These three parts set the \"mood of the story.

base of my life. </s> <s> \"- In my conclusion this is why I think the authors mood in the story is very thankful and greatful. </s> <s> There are many ways to describe the mood in \"Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives\", by Narciso Rodriguez. </s> <s> First, the mood is family-friendly. </s> <s> This is because in paragraph @NUM1, the author states \"the innocence of child hood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home.\" </s> <s> Also, the mood is very joy ful. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM2, the author

</s> <s> His parents were immigrants from Cuba and he still got the education he wanted, even though his parents went through tough times. </s> <s> The mood of this story is happy. </s> <s> I think this because in the memoir it talks about cuban fiests, being with family, and friends and it seems like its a good time. </s> <s> Also I think this because it talks about good memories wich is always a happy thing. </s> <s> And it's all celebrations and being together wich is always a good thing. </s> <s> In this memoir, \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is certain mood. </s> <s> I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. </s> <s> The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. </s> <s> When talking about his home, he says \"Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. </s> <s> My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful).\" </s> <s> I would say that is pretty enlightening. </s> <s> He also says how grateful he is for his parents. </s> <s> The mood of this memoir is nothing but good. </s> <s> Narciso was very grateful of his parents they had love, happiness, depression and maybe more. </s> <s> The author's memoir was sad, but also a loving memoir. </s> <s> \"In 1961, I was born into this simple house, within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home.\" </s> <s> Narciso loved his parents for making a simple house into a traditional Cuban home. </s> <s> He also loved how his parents made their own home. </s> <s> \"My mother and father had to come to this country with such corage, they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life.\" </s> <s> Narciso  was so grateful he thank his parent every day that created love. </s> <s> \"It was this simple house that my parents celebrate my first birthday\". </s> <s> He kept the house as a memoir to remind himself of how he came to america. </s> <s> it was loving, caring, and also cheerful. </s> <s> The author of the story creates a mood to help really emphasize the point of his story. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez explains how his parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1 and try to find new jobs and start new lives. </s> <s> Rodriguez also explains how he learned to call his neighbors family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures \"came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1, he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always a seated around the table. </s> <s> Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant mood in this memoir. </s> <s> In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. </s> <s> Here is what is.Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because like Narciso says in the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, \"In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lifes over entirely, taking what ever work they could find.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised into a wonderfly cultural enviorment. </s> <s> An enviorment filled with his \"family\". </s> <s> When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. </s> <s> He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. </s> <s> Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. </s> <s> A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. </s> <s> The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents \"turned the simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> This is what the tone of this memoir is. </s> <s> The mood of the author is happy. </s> <s> The mood is happy because they doesn't really mention any negative thoughts or feelings at all. </s> <s> He mentions throughout the story, how he is so grateful for his family, like his mom and dad. </s> <s> He talks about himself being cuban, and how proud he is to be Cuban. </s> <s> The narrator has a bunch of good thoughts, about his mother and father. </s> <s> He mentioned in the story \"I will alway be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. </s> <s> He always tells his parents of how proud he is of them, and mentions how their basically an @CAPS1. </s> <s> In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood. </s> <s> He talks about family, love, and home. </s> <s> For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. </s> <s> In his neighborhood, Narciso says that \"cultures came together\" and that his parents \"always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" </s> <s> I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. </s> <s> Narciso believes that his home was filled with \"not just scent and music, but life and love.\" </s> <s> I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memior. </s> <s> First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents. </s> <s> Narciso explains that \"they had to start their lives over entirely.\" </s> <s> (@CAPS1 @NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. </s> <s> He understands that they only left for his benefit, and he appreciates that. </s> <s> Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they kept their Cuban traditions. </s> <s> In Narciso's three room apartment, \"Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen\" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). </s> <s> Lastly, Narciso expresses his appreciation, and strengthens the mood by defining what a home is. </s> <s> He claims that he \"will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home\" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). </s> <s> For these, Narciso is grateful for, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood. </s> <s> In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood of family and caring is set. </s> <s> The first way this mood is set is by the the passionate Cuban music and the home cooked meals. </s> <s> Rodriguez writes, \"passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" </s> <s> (p. @NUM1). </s> <s> This quote exentuates the mood of family because the music and food of thier nationality gives a feeling of comfort. </s> <s> The comfort with you family and to the mood of family. </s> <s> Another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house. </s> <s> Rodriguez writes,\"... </s> <s> I was born in this simple house situated in a two family, blonde-brick building...\" (p. @NUM2). </s> <s> This adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family. </s> <s> This also adds a cozy feel to the environment. </s> <s> Finaly, the mood of family is contributed to by how close their family lives. </s> <s> Rodriguez writes, \"My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby\" (p. @NUM2). </s> <s> Family living nearby contributes to the mood of family because it exentuntes the number of family members which exentuates the mood of family. </s> <s> Based on the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a strong mood of family is expressed. </s> <s> one mood of this memoir was that of a traditional Cuban home. </s> <s> In the memoir, paragraph @NUM1, \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). </s> <s> Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.\" </s> <s> A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced my hardships. </s> <s> In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 \"They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.\" </s> <s> The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty and friendship. </s> <s> In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 \"It was here where I learned the real definition of \"family\". </s> <s> And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. </s> <s> I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. </s> <s> The mood of the @CAPS1 is happy. </s> <s> In the memior, Narciso Rodriguez describes the happy and fun times of living in her small home in New Jersey. </s> <s> He describes how his family, which consisted of her mother and father turned their @CAPS2 house into a cuban home and opened the doors to other refugees that were going through difficult times. </s> <s> In the last @CAPS4 Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather. </s> <s> The message the @CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be. </s> <s> The reason I know the @CAPS3 mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life. </s> <s> Her home wasn't big and fancy but as described in @CAPS4 @NUM1 \"It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees.\" </s> <s> In this @CAPS5 he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love. </s> <s> Narciso's once simple house had turned into a home, filled with friends and family. </s> <s> In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. </s> <s> In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a \"blood\" relative. </s> <s> He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. </s> <s> I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family! </s> <s> In the memoir, the mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and cheerful. </s> <s> One example that describes this is from paragraph @NUM1. </s> <s> This is where he described his neighborhood, saying \"In our neighberhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other. </s> <s> Also, in paragraph @NUM2, the author says that his parents came to @LOCATION1 selflessly, to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their home country. </s> <s> Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memorice of his home, where he had birthdays, parties, and family. </s> <s> He said that there was the scent of life and love in the air. </s> <s> For this he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of \"family.\" </s> <s> The mood in this story is very happy. </s> <s> In this answer I will show how he created it.Firstly, the author always had a good mood no matter what happened or what his parents didn't do. </s> <s> He had great memories of the kitchen smelling good. </s> <s> He also loved his Cuban music.Secondly, he showed how thankful he was towards his family for bringing him into this world and caring for them.These two

Rodriguez described his home to be a place of childhood innocence, family, friends, and endless celebrations. </s> <s> Another mood is gratitude for I have never given up my friends, family, and home

family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the @PERSON2, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble. </s> <s> In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made the readers feel many moods while telling his insperational story. </s> <s> In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, she uses key terms and phrases to discuss the mood in paragraph @NUM1

mood that sets off in the beggining of the story is how in her house cuban music and great aroma's From @CAPS1's @CAPS2 through the air, I also think that it gives picture of laughter and happiness, And I think that throughout the story @CAPS3 tells that @CAPS3 relizes through spending time with community that his parents are teaching him, Just because someone isn't blood related dosent mean they can't be lik family as said in the package, There teaching him that It Is also people that love you and care about you. </s> <s> As @CAPS3 continues through the passage It says that his family is all ways open to take care of people that they love and need help. </s> <s> @CAPS3 soon relizes that all his family gave up from their old lives was so that they could provide a nice home for him and teach him a valuable lesson in Life the true meaning of family. </s> <s> In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by himself from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives it talks about this fashion designers life. </s> <s> One example is in paragraph @NUM1 page @NUM2 it talks about his backround Narciso states \"My parent, originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956...\" The paragraph goes on talking about his parents and their names. </s> <s> Nex it is paragraph @NUM3 page @NUM2. </s> <s> This sets the mood of him growing up in a new inviorment. </s> <s> For example he States \"Growing up

creates the author. </s> <s> The author creates many moods in the story. </s> <s> While reading this story I felt happy, sometimes sad and overall it made me feel good.The mood that the author is trying to sel is happieness and unity. </s> <s> even though many cultures and ethnic backgrounds were in his neiborhood they all came together as one. </s> <s> Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still in america. </s> <s> The story makes me feel good because the author is trying to say that it is not the materialistic things that make you happy it is the family and freinds that surroud you every single day. </s> <s> I believe the was more of a \"thank you\" in the memoir and here a three reasons. </s> <s> I think Narciso Rodriguez is thanking his parents for making him have a good childhood. </s> <s> Like in the excerpt \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. </s> <s> Another reason I think he's thanking his parents because he was praising them. </s> <s> In the excerpt \"I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 Narciso is forever

their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. </s> <s> They struggled both personally and financially,\". </s> <s> The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for  all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir. </s> <s> In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author is togetherness. </s> <s> There are many other words to describe the mood, but togetherness describes the family as a whole. </s> <s> The parents accepted almost anybody into their home and they were very welcoming. </s> <s> To illustrate this, it says in the memoir, \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 could also describe the mood because the Rodriguez family let their neighbors and family to their table and they were very friendly. </s> <s> In the memoir it states, \"My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table.\" </s> <s> That quote also shows togetherness within the family. </s> <s> That the Rodriguez family stayed together through all the hard times of moving countries, getting new jobs, and starting over was really an accomplishment, especially in @LOCATION1. </s> <s> The memoir shows that, \"... My parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved.\" </s> <s> @CAPS2, the family created the mood of togetherness, especially going through hard times. </s> <s> I think the mood the author is trying to give is thankful, and satisfied, and that he is loved. </s> <s> An example of his satisfaction is \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the to life in our home.\" </s> <s> And an example of his thankfulness is \"My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today...\" And lastely an example of him being loved is \"Growing up in this enviorment instilled me a great sense that \"family\" had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" </s> <s> I can tell that Narciso feels all three of those feelings and he presents it well. </s> <s> The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir. </s> <s> Is a very happy and grateful mood. </s> <s> It is happy because in paragraph @NUM1 it says \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, Formed the backdrop to life and are warm home. </s> <s> It is grateful because he says in paragraph @NUM2 \"They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it means leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. </s> <s> In paragraph @NUM3 it says \"I will

him. </s> <s> The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. </s> <s> Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. </s> <s> His home was a \"traditional Cuban home\". </s> <s> By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant. </s> <s> \"Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home\". </s> <s> Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories. </s> <s> In the memoir of \"Narciso Rodriguez\" by Narciso Rodriguez. </s> <s> The mood of the reading could be described as grateful. </s> <s> I can sense this mood by some of the things Narciso Rodriguez mentions. </s> <s> The author would constantly say \"thank you\" to his parents for all the sacarfies they had to mak for a suitable living enviroment for Narciso. </s> <s> It also states that \"there was no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are.\" </s> <s> Over all, in the memoir of @PERSON1 the mood can be mainly described as Grateful towards his parents, heritage and home. </s> <s> @CAPS4 on the article Narciso Rodriguez\" by from Home: the @CAPS1 of Our Lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir is loving, happiness, and greatful. </s> <s> There are many @CAPS2 showing the mood @CAPS4 on the article. </s> <s> For @CAPS2 one of the moods created is shown in para @NUM1 \"gratefull.\" </s> <s> @CAPS2: \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> @CAPS3 that he love them anyways even if it is good or bad. </s> <s> Another @CAPS2

</s> <s> @CAPS3 he does it with love, another mood in the article. </s> <s> Those are the moods created by the author in the memoir, @CAPS4 on the article \"Narciso Rodriguez by \"from Home: The

his parents as well. </s> <s> His parents helped him and gave him hope. </s> <s> He also uses music to simbolize his life. </s> <s> Now he is a successfull fashion designer. </s> <s> The mood created by the author in the memoir was mellow because he's talking about his life and his greatfuless to have been raised in @LOCATION1. </s> <s> Also the mood was happy, because he said \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home\" which is him talking about how his parents made @LOCATION1 feel like home. </s> <s> Those with the moods of the story The mood in the memoir represents friendship, family, helpfulness, one example of helpfulness is in the @NUM1 paragraph it says \"It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working, immigrints who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own Kind, were clearly in need.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 good example of the mood in this memoir is family but also ties back to helping is in paragraph @NUM2 it says, \"My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concider family. </s> <s> Knowing that they would do the same for us. </s> <s> This is what the memoir is about. </s> <s> The mood created by the author was a happy and exciting mood. </s> <s> This is because the family was so excited about moving to a new place with better oppertunities and educational purposes. </s> <s> It also changed a regular house into a special home for them because they had people over and over and over which finally became family. </s> <s> The neighbors also helped create the mood by not creating any negative action or violence in the author put the family's location in a non-american neighborhood. </s> <s> The mood of the memoir is kind and loving. </s> <s> It showed kindness in paragraph @NUM1, what the memoir described how his parents made the whole house feel sweet and nice. </s> <s> He did this by using words like \"innocence\", \"celebrations\", and \"warm home\" to create a the feel of kindness. </s> <s> Love was shown when the author told about the way his parents welcomed anyone of every race to live with them until they \"got back on their feet.\" </s> <s> This shows love because when you are welcomed no matter what the problem is or who you are, it deminstrates love to everyone. </s> <s> When you have a loving family and a beautiful home, you should be very grateful. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez was also very grateful. </s> <s> The overall mood of Narciso's story is gratefulness. </s> <s> Narciso Rodriguez was born in 1961 in Newark, New Jersey. </s> <s> His memoir explains how @CAPS1 is grateful for everything. </s> <s> \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 would always tell his parents about his admiration for their strength and perseverance. </s> <s> His family cared for everybody and \"Always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" </s> <s> All and All the memoir's mood is gratefulness because Narciso was very grateful for everything. </s> <s> All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the @CAPS1 in this  memoir. </s> <s> But the biggest feeling of all is love his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give @CAPS2 a better life, Even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, friends all behind just to give their son a better life. </s> <s> Also after they arrived they lived in a one room apartment for a year then moved to a new house and made it \"our traditional Cuban home\" so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso When he was born. </s> <s> Even after that they were still kind and had open arm for other immagrants. </s> <s> So I absolutly think that the @CAPS1 in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love. </s> <s> The ather creats mood in the memoir in soe ways. </s> <s> In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author says, \"Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.\" </s> <s> His is an example because it is sayin That in some environments everyone is your family. </s> <s> In @NUM2 the author says, \"I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifices.\" </s> <s> This is an example because he appreciates everything that his parents did for him and he  always will too. </s> <s> That is how the author creates a mood The author showed his mood very clearly in the memoir. </s> <s> The way he worded things such as \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home\" Showed how happy he was toward his parents. </s> <s> He told us how greatful he was for his parents

throughout the story, the other kept stating that he is extremely grateful to his parents for their selflessness and care. </s> <s> This mood shows most in paragraph @NUM1 because he continually thanks his parents for moving to the United States from Cuba to help him when he is born. </s> <s> He thanks them for leaving their friends, family and jobs to help him, even if the new jobs they get are not what they deserve.So, as you can see, the author is very grateful to his parents, making this the mood. </s> <s> I think that the mood created by the speaker is gratitude. </s> <s> I think this @CAPS1 his parents \"unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)\" </s> <s> This shows that

everything. </s> <s> He describes his home in such a relaxed way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also good to eachother. </s> <s> It gives the empression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is right. </s> <s> He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and being a child I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. </s> <s> He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser paying work. </s> <s> Sacrifices like those make me feel as if there is pure love left in the world, I only wish my parents cared like that. </s> <s> Though this story proves the love of two parents to their children, and that alone makes me feel a sense of peaceful closure. </s> <s> In the article Narciso Rodriguez the tone is loving, peaceful and happy. </s> <s> In this memoir it talks about family and friend coming together as one. </s> <s> In the article the best example of happiness and peace is the last sentence, \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" </s> <s> This shows joy because they are all together. </s> <s> Another example is in paragraph seven where he says I learned the real definition of family.\" </s> <s> This is loving because it shows he is happy and he enjoys being with friends

conclusion the tone is happy, loving and grateful I think the memoir is a thankful and grateful mood. </s> <s> The author is grateful that she has parents that moved to @LOCATION1 for her. </s> <s> Also she is grateful that the simple place she lives in feels like a home. </s> <s> This says so in the last sentence \"I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.\" </s>

forever appriciative to his parents and their strong desitions that made him the person @CAPS2 is today. </s> <s> The mood of the memoir is actually happy and grateful. </s> <s> I think this because

bravery. </s> <s> He @CAPS1 he thanked them repeatedly and he could never have enough bravery to do that. </s> <s> That is how it is grateful. </s> <s> Something about the story has a very happy feel to it. </s> <s> Because the family is together and they are talking about how happy they are living with each other and even in @LOCATION1 it adds a very happy feel to it. </s> <s> That is what I think the author tried to create in the memoir. </s> <s> In the memoir \"Narciso Rodriguez\" Narciso tells all about his parents and how greatful he is. </s> <s> Narciso created a mood during this

meant them having to leave behind family, friends and careers. </s> <s> The mood created overall was that I felt thankful for my home and family here in @LOCATION1. </s> <s> Then I also felt sympathy for Narciso's parents for leaving everything behind for their children. </s> <s> they also had to leave behind family, which is very hard to do. </s> <s> Narciso's parents made a very tough but wise deisicon but in the end it was worth it. </s> <s> The mood created by the author in the memoir I would have to say a loving mood because through-out the whole memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about how loving and caring and selflessness his parents were. </s> <s> For example in paragraph @NUM1 it states \"They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.\" </s> <s> Also near the end of paragraph @NUM1 it says \"In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. </s> <s> In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. </s> <s> The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times.\" </s> <s> @CAPS1 are two reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood. </s> <s> Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says \"countless extended family members came and went- and their was often someone staying with us temporarily untill they were able to get back on their feet. </s> <s> My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.\" </s> <s> That is the final reason of why I think the mood of the memoir is a loving mood. </s> <s> In the memoir, @PERSON1, by @PERSON1, he talks about how thankful he is. </s> <s> One thing is that he is thankful for his babysitter and friend giving them food when they needed it. </s> <s> Also he was thankful for the community he had. </s> <s> Lastly, he was thankful for his parents' love and sacrifice.He said that \"@CAPS1 graced our kitchen

<s> This shows how thankful he is toward his parents for sacrificing almost everything for him.By Narciso Rodriguez wrote this in a thankful mood. </s> <s> He thanks his babysitter, he thanks his community, and he thanks his parents. </s> <s> All of them contributed to his life. </s> <s> The mood that is @CAPS1 and that it is created by the author in the memoir is the feeling of being thankful. </s> <s> This is the mood @CAPS1 because it says \"Their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful).\" </s> <s> This @CAPS3 the mood is thankful because author is thankful for the culinary skills that is still with him. </s> <s> Another that @CAPS3 the mood thankful is when it says \"I will always be grateful to my

grateful for family and friends. </s> <s> All of this blends together to form a happy, good, warm mood to the story. </s> <s> In the excerpt of the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood created is one of love for family and friends. </s> <s> The author explains his parents reasons for immigrating with such love and devotion that it is hard to not feel the same way.

Cuba so he can have a better life. </s> <s> A life that his family can be proud of. </s> <s> The mood of this memoir is nonfiction. </s> <s> The mood is that because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about
